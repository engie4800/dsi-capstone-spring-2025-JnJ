      "Summary of cost-effectiveness evidence\n",
      "The cost-effectiveness of baricitinib in severe AA was evaluated versus ‘watch and wait’, the\n",
      "most clinically relevant comparator for this population, due to a lack of high-quality clinical data\n",
      "for another comparator. In the probabilistic base case, baricitinib was associated with higher\n",
      "costs (£***** per patient over a lifetime horizon) and higher benefits (**** QALYs per patient over\n",
      "a lifetime horizon) compared with ‘watch and wait’. The base case probabilistic ICER was\n",
      "£29,111 per QALY gained and did not differ meaningfully from the deterministic ICER (£29,395\n",
      "per QALY gained). In absolute terms, base case probabilistic results suggested that baricitinib\n",
      "4mg was associated with a total cost of £******, of which £****** related to drug acquisition. These\n",
      "were partially compensated by cost savings due to reduced disease management costs,\n",
      "psychological burden costs and BSC drug monitoring costs. The PSA results indicated that\n",
      "baricitinib was ****% likely to be cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000 per\n",
      "QALY gained.\n",
      "Overall, the results indicate that baricitinib to be a cost-effective option for the treatment of\n",
      "severe AA within the NHS versus ‘watch and wait’.\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "The cost-effectiveness model developed for this submission has several strengths. The efficacy\n",
      "of baricitinib is based largely on robust phase III clinical trial data derived from two clinical trials.\n",
      "The model was built to align with the NICE reference case, adopting an NHS and PSS\n",
      "perspective, a lifetime time horizon to fully capture all costs and QALY gains associated with the\n",
      "interventions, and discount rates for costs and benefits of 3.5%. Utility data were elicited directly\n",
      "from AA patients in Europe, including the UK and were cross-walked from the EQ-5D-5L to the\n",
      "EQ-5D-3L, in line with the latest NICE guidance.\n",
      "Limitations\n",
      "There are some limitations to the current modelling approach that should be considered. Firstly,\n",
      "there was no previously published economic model for AA and therefore the current model\n",
      "structure was based on similar models in other dermatological disorders. The model structure\n",
      "and the key assumptions have been tested with clinical experts to ensure the model adequately\n",
      "captures disease progression and the main clinical and economics aspects of the disease,\n",
      "however, there remains an extent of uncertainty as to how well the model predicts the cost-\n",
      "effectiveness of baricitinib for the treatment of AA. Second, discontinuation rates for baricitinib\n",
      "and ‘watch and wait’ were based on data from the phase III studies with follow-up until Week 52\n",
      "and Week 36 respectively. Given that these rates in the maintenance phase were used from\n",
      "Week 36 and beyond to estimate the probability of remaining in maintenance, there is inherent\n",
      "uncertainty on long-term discontinuation rates and the predictions they make. Third, the BSC\n",
      "health state assumes that patients would not benefit from treatment despite receiving a basket of\n",
      "various off-label therapies for the management of AA. This approach can underestimate the\n",
      "benefit that these patients exhibit from the BSC treatments, however, given the lack of\n",
      "comparative efficacy data for these treatments it was not possible to estimate their impact in\n",
      "efficacy and HRQoL terms. In addition to this, given the frequency of AEs and high relapse rates\n",
      "associated with such therapies, the extent of benefit of BSC for patients with AA is questionable.\n",
