Conversely, efficacy data\\nwere presented at Week 66 in this appraisal, as efficacy endpoints at Week 85 were exploratory\\nand assessed as a post hoc outcome. Additionally, efficacy data for the NEURO-TTR external\\nplacebo group were not collected beyond Week 66.\\nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events\\nAn overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from the final analysis of\\nNEURO-TTRansform and HELIOS-A is presented in Table 36. In NEURO-TTRansform, the final\\nanalysis of safety data took place at Week 85 for the eplontersen arm and Week 66 for the\\nexternal placebo arm. The final analysis in HELIOS-A took place at 18 months (78 weeks).\\nThe number of patients who had experienced any TEAE was comparable across treatment\\ngroups with 98% of patients reporting TEAEs by Week 85 in the NEURO-TTRansform\\neplontersen group, and by Month 18 in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group.53, 54 The proportion of\\npatients who discontinued study drug treatment due to TEAEs was slightly lower for vutrisiran\\n(3%; by Month 18) compared with eplontersen (6%; by Week 85). The proportion of severe and\\nserious TEAEs was lower in the eplontersen group (severe: 14%; serious 19%) compared with\\nthe vutrisiran group (severe: 16%; serious: 26%).53, 54\\nDeaths\\nDuring NEURO-TTRansform, ***** patients experienced fatal TEAEs by the Week 85 analysis,\\n***** of which were in the eplontersen group, although no deaths due to study drug were reported\\n(Table 36).52 The death rate as a proportion of eplontersen-exposed patients was 2% (3/144),\\nwhich is equal to the rate of death in patients who received vutrisiran in HELIOS-A (2%).53, 54\\nCompany evidence submission template for eplontersen for treating hereditary transthyretin-\\nrelated amyloidosis [ID 6337]\\n© AstraZeneca (2024).

At the Week 35 interim analysis, treatment with eplontersen resulted\\nin a -81.2% (95% CI: -84.6%, -77.8%) LSM CfB in serum TTR which was maintained at Week 65\\nwith a -81.7% CfB (95% CI: -84.8%, -78.5%). The LSM difference in serum TTR between the\\neplontersen group and placebo group at Week 65 was statistically significant, with a -70.4%\\nreduction in favour of eplontersen (95% CI: -75.2%, -65.7%; p<0.001) (Section B.3.6.1).\\nEplontersen was also effective in preventing deterioration in polyneuropathy impairment. At the\\nWeek 35 interim analysis, the LSM CfB in mNIS+7 score was 0.22 (95% CI: -3.5, 3.9). This was\\nmaintained until Week 66, with a LSM CfB of 0.3 (95% CI: -4.5, 5.1). At Week 66, the LSM\\ndifference between eplontersen and the external placebo group was statistically significant, with\\na -24.8 reduction in mNIS+7 score in favour of eplontersen (95% CI: -31.0, -18.6; p<0.001).53\\nTreatment with eplontersen also resulted in reduced scores for patients completing the Norfolk\\nQoL-DN questionnaire, indicating improvements in patient’s quality of life, which given the high\\nmorbidity burden associated with ATTRv-PN, is an important outcome. Eplontersen was superior\\nto the external placebo in reducing the Norfolk QoL-DN score from baseline at both Week 35 and\\nWeek 66. At Week 66, treatment with eplontersen resulted in a LSM CfB of -5.5 (95% CI: -10.0, -\\n1.0) in Norfolk QoL-DN total score and the observed difference between the eplontersen and\\nexternal placebo group was statistically significant, with a LSM difference of -19.7, in favour of\\neplontersen (95% CI: -25.6, -13.8; p<0.001).53\\nThe results of the secondary endpoints were also positive, demonstrating that eplontersen\\nresults in improvements in mobility (PND score), nutritional status (mBMI), QoL (SF-36) and\\nneuropathy (NSC) when compared to placebo.\\nComparability to Vutrisiran\\nAs described in Section B.1.3.5, UK clinical expert validation indicated that *** ** *** patients with\\nATTRv-PN at the NAC are treated with vutrisiran, indicating that it is the only relevant comparator\\nfor eplontersen in UK clinical practice.20 This was also confirmed in the response by NICE to the\\ndraft scope for this appraisal.3 Since direct clinical evidence for eplontersen versus vutrisiran is\\nnot available, an unanchored MAIC and STC were conducted to compare the efficacy of\\neplontersen in the NEURO-TTRansform trial versus vutrisiran in the pivotal HELIOS-A trial.\\nThe co-primary endpoints in the NEURO-TTRansform trial (serum TTR, mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-\\nDN) were considered in the ITCs, as clinically meaningful endpoints for patients with ATTRv-PN.\\nCompany evidence submission template for eplontersen for treating hereditary transthyretin-\\nrelated amyloidosis [ID 6337]\\n© AstraZeneca (2024). All rights reserved Page 79 of 95\\nUnanchored MAIC and STC models showed no statistically significant differences in absolute\\nserum TTR concentration, absolute CfB in serum TTR concentration or percent CfB in serum\\nTTR between eplontersen and vutrisiran, at steady state. Similarly, both unanchored MAIC and\\nSTC showed no statistically significant differences between eplontersen and vutrisiran in terms of\\nchange in mNIS+7 composite score from baseline to Week 80.\\nEplontersen treatment resulted in a sustained benefit in QoL. For the Norfolk QoL-DN, a\\nstatistically significant difference in CfB was observed between treatments at Week 80; both the\\nMAIC and STC models showed that eplontersen statistically significantly reduced the Norfolk\\nQoL-DN score from baseline (indicating an improvement in patient’s quality of life) when\\ncompared to vutrisiran. No statistically significant difference was observed between eplontersen\\nand vutrisiran in terms of the odds of a response (response defined as a CfB <0) in Norfolk QoL-\\nDN at Week 80.\\nCombined, these ITC results demonstrate that vutrisiran and eplontersen have similar treatment\\neffects, with statistically significant differences between the two treatments observed for the CfB\\nin Norfolk QoL-DN, in favour of eplontersen. Input from UK clinical experts confirmed that\\neplontersen and vutrisiran have similar treatment effects.20\\nSafety Profile\\nAlongside similar treatment effects, the safety profile of eplontersen observed in the NEURO-\\nTTRansform trial was generally tolerable and closely aligned with the safety profile for vutrisiran\\nobserved in HELIOS-A. At the final analysis (Week 85 for NEURO-TTRansform and 18 months\\nfor HELIOS-A), the proportion of severe and serious TEAEs was lower in the eplontersen group\\n(severe: 14%; serious 19%) compared with the vutrisiran group (severe: 16%; serious: 26%).9, 30\\nFurthermore, unanchored MAICs and STCs showed no significant differences in terms of the\\nodds of a serious or severe AEs, or treatment discontinuation events between eplontersen and\\nvutrisiran.\\nConclusion\\nOverall, the comparative efficacy and safety data provide clear evidence that the efficacy and\\nsafety of eplontersen should be considered to be similar to that of vutrisiran for the treatment of\\npatients with ATTRv-PN. As such, a cost-comparison appraisal should be considered appropriate\\nfor eplontersen.\\nCompared to vutrisiran, eplontersen would offer a therapeutic option for slowing or halting\\nprogression of this irreversible, fatal condition that provides more autonomy and can be self-\\nadministered at home.\\nOngoing studies\\nThe ongoing open-label extension study of NEURO-TTRansform is ongoing (NCT05071300),\\nwith expected completion in ****.78\\nCompany evidence submission template for eplontersen for treating hereditary transthyretin-\\nrelated amyloidosis [ID 6337]\\n© AstraZeneca (2024).

There is an overall cost differential of ******** between the two treatments, showing\\neplontersen to be cost-saving in terms of acquisition and administration costs. This\\ncomparison is based on the with-PAS price for eplontersen and list price for vutrisiran.\\n• Cost savings for patients treated with eplontersen were maintained in scenario analyses.\\nChanges in service provision and management'"
