Pre-hospital initiation of fluid replacement therapy in trauma,"It is recommended that in the pre-hospital management of adults and older children, intravenous (IV) fluid should not be administered if a radial pulse can be felt (or, for penetrating torso injuries, if a central pulse can be felt). | In the absence of a radial pulse (or a central pulse for penetrating torso injuries) in adults and older children, it is recommended that IV fluid should be administered in boluses of no more than 250 ml. The patient should then be reassessed, and the process repeated until a radial pulse (or central pulse for penetrating torso injuries) is palpable. | The administration of IV fluid should not delay transportation to hospital, but when given in accordance with section 1.2, consideration should be given to administration en route to hospital. | It is recommended that when IV fluid is indicated in the pre-hospital setting, crystalloid solutions should be the routine choice. | There is inadequate evidence on which the Institute can base recommendations on when pre-hospital use of IV fluid in young children and infants following trauma is appropriate, or on the volumes of fluid to use. However, there is a broad consensus that transfer to hospital should not be delayed by attempts to administer IV fluid. | It is recommended that only healthcare professionals who have been appropriately trained in advanced life-support techniques and pre-hospital care should administer IV fluid therapy to trauma patients in the pre-hospital setting. | Training programmes for healthcare professionals should incorporate the above recommendations.",Approved
Guidance on the use of liquid-based cytology for cervical screening,It is recommended that liquid-based cytology (LBC) is used as the primary means of processing samples in the cervical screening programme in England and Wales. | There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend one LBC product over another. The NHS Cervical Screening Programme and Cervical Screening Wales may wish to consider evaluating further the different products as the method is introduced.,Approved
Human growth hormone (somatropin) in adults with growth hormone deficiency,"Recombinant human growth hormone (somatropin) treatment is recommended for the treatment of adults with growth hormone (GH) deficiency only if they fulfil all 3 of the following criteria. They have severe GH deficiency, defined as a peak GH response of less than 9 mU/litre (3 ng/ml) during an insulin tolerance test or a cross-validated GH threshold in an equivalent test. They have a perceived impairment of quality of life (QoL), as demonstrated by a reported score of at least 11 in the disease-specific 'Quality of life assessment of growth hormone deficiency in adults' (QoL-AGHDA) questionnaire. They are already receiving treatment for any other pituitary hormone deficiencies as required. | The QoL status of people who are given GH treatment should be re-assessed 9 months after the initiation of therapy (an initial 3-month period of GH dose titration, followed by a 6-month therapeutic trial period). GH treatment should be discontinued for those people who demonstrate a QoL improvement of less than 7 points in QoL-AGHDA score. | Patients who develop GH deficiency in early adulthood, after linear growth is completed but before the age of 25 years, should be given GH treatment until adult peak bone mass has been achieved, provided they satisfy the biochemical criteria for severe GH deficiency (defined as a peak GH response of less than 9 mU/litre (3 ng/ml) during an insulin tolerance test or a cross-validated GH threshold in an equivalent test). After adult peak bone mass has been achieved, the decision to continue GH treatment should be based on all the criteria in section 1.1. | Patients currently receiving GH treatment, for the management of adult onset GH deficiency, whether as routine therapy or as part of a clinical trial, could suffer loss of wellbeing if their treatment were to be discontinued at a time they did not anticipate. Because of this, all NHS patients who are on therapy at the date of publication of this guidance should have the option to continue treatment until they and their consultant consider it is appropriate to stop. | Children with GH deficiency should be treated as outlined in NICE's technology appraisal guidance 42 (replaced byNICE's technology appraisal guidance on human growth hormone (somatropin) for the treatment growth failure in children). At completion of linear growth (that is, growth rate less than 2 cm/year), GH treatment should be stopped for 2 to 3 months, and then GH status should be re-assessed. GH treatment at adult doses should be re-started only in those satisfying the biochemical criteria for severe GH deficiency (defined as a peak GH response of less than 9 mU/litre (3 ng/ml) during an insulin tolerance test or a cross-validated GH threshold in an equivalent test), and continued until adult peak bone mass has been achieved (normally around 25 years of age). After adult peak bone mass has been achieved, the decision to continue GH treatment should be based on all the criteria set out in section 1.1. | Initiation of GH treatment, dose titration and assessment of response during trial periods should be undertaken by a consultant endocrinologist with a special interest in the management of GH disorders. Thereafter, if maintenance treatment is to be prescribed in primary care, it is recommended that this should be under an agreed shared-care protocol.",Conditional
Guidance on the use of capecitabine and tegafur with uracil for metastatic colorectal cancer,Oral therapy with capecitabine is recommended as an option for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. | The choice of regimen (intravenous fluorouracil/folinic acid [5-FU/FA] or capecitabine) should be made jointly by the individual and the clinician(s) responsible for treatment. The decision should be made after an informed discussion between the clinician(s) and the patient; this discussion should take into account contraindications and the side-effect profile of the agents as well as the clinical condition and preferences of the individual. | The use of capecitabine to treat metastatic colorectal cancer should be supervised by oncologists who specialise in colorectal cancer.,Approved
Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,"It is recommended that, in hospital, the choice of thrombolytic drug (alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase or tenecteplase) should take account of: the likely balance of benefit and harm (for example, stroke) to which each of the thrombolytic agents would expose the individual patient current UK clinical practice, in which it is accepted that patients who have previously received streptokinase should not be treated with it again the hospital's arrangements for reducing delays in the administration of thrombolysis. | Where pre-hospital delivery of thrombolytic drugs is considered a beneficial approach as part of an emergency-care pathway for AMI (for example, because of population geography or the accessibility of acute hospital facilities), the practicalities of administering thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings mean that the bolus drugs (reteplase or tenecteplase) are recommended as the preferred option.",Approved
Guidance on the use of ultrasound locating devices for placing central venous catheters,Two-dimensional (2D) imaging ultrasound guidance is recommended as the preferred method for insertion of central venous catheters (CVCs) into the internal jugular vein (IJV) in adults and children in elective situations. | The use of 2D imaging ultrasound guidance should be considered in most clinical circumstances where CVC insertion is necessary either electively or in an emergency situation. | It is recommended that all those involved in placing CVCs using 2D imaging ultrasound guidance should undertake appropriate training to achieve competence. | Audio-guided Doppler ultrasound guidance is not recommended for CVC insertion.,Rejected
Guidance on the use of trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer,Trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel (combination trastuzumab is currently only licensed for use with paclitaxel) is recommended as an option for people with tumours expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scored at levels of 3 or more who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and in whom anthracycline treatment is inappropriate. | Trastuzumab monotherapy is recommended as an option for people with tumours expressing HER2 scored at levels of 3 or more who have received at least 2 chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane where these treatments are appropriate. It should also have included hormonal therapy in suitable oestrogen receptor-positive patients. | HER2 levels should be scored using validated immunohistochemical techniques and in accordance with published guidelines. Laboratories offering tissue sample immunocytochemical or other predictive tests for therapy response should use validated standardised assay methods and participate in and demonstrate satisfactory performance in a recognised external quality assurance scheme.,Approved
Guidance on the use of fludarabine for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"Oral fludarabine is recommended as second line therapy for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for patients who have either failed, or are intolerant of, first line chemotherapy, and who would otherwise have received combination chemotherapy of either: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisolone (CAP) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) | The oral formulation of fludarabine is preferred to the intravenous formulation on the basis of more favourable cost effectiveness. Intravenous fludarabine should only be used when oral fludarabine is contraindicated.",Approved
Guidance on the use of riluzole (Rilutek) for the treatment of motor neurone disease,Riluzole is recommended for the treatment of individuals with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) form of motor neurone disease (MND). | Riluzole therapy should be initiated by a neurological specialist with expertise in the management of MND. Routine supervision of therapy should be managed by locally agreed shared care protocols undertaken by general practitioners.,Approved
Guidance on the extraction of wisdom teeth,"The practice of prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molars should be discontinued in the NHS. | The standard routine programme of dental care by dental practitioners and/or paraprofessional staff need be no different, in general, for pathology-free impacted third molars (those requiring no additional investigations or procedures). | Surgical removal of impacted third molars should be limited to patients with evidence of pathology. Such pathology includes unrestorable caries, non-treatable pulpal and/or periapical pathology, cellulitis, abscess and osteomyelitis, internal/external resorption of the tooth or adjacent teeth, fracture of tooth, disease of follicle including cyst/tumour, tooth/teeth impeding surgery or reconstructive jaw surgery, and when a tooth is involved in or within the field of tumour resection. | Specific attention is drawn to plaque formation and pericoronitis. Plaque formation is a risk factor but is not in itself an indication for surgery. The degree to which the severity or recurrence rate of pericoronitis should influence the decision for surgical removal of a third molar remains unclear. The evidence suggests that a first episode of pericoronitis, unless particularly severe, should not be considered an indication for surgery. Second or subsequent episodes should be considered the appropriate indication for surgery.",Rejected
