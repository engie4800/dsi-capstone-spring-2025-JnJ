timepoint was later)"

methods, overview of studies and results of the identified studies, together with the quality 
assessments"
"Was there a QALY benefit? High, medium, low?","As such, these factors, which are also likely to affect 
patients’ QoL, may be considered qualitatively outside the QALY calculation"

Company consider any bias associated with this exclusion method to be minimal (as 
discussed by Rehman et al"
Was the Quality of Evidence high?,"List of relevant clinical effectiveness 
evidence"
"Were there surrogate endpoints used, or hard ones?",Results for this secondary endpoint are presented in Table 19
Was there an indirect or direct comparison to the alternative?,"This means that it is not 
possible to compare the outputs of this model with other economic analyses relevant to this

included patients who died before the assessment could have been done"
