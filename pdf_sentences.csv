"Decision problem, description of the technology and 
clinical care pathway 
Summary 
Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapy options for treating childhood cancer"
"
However, it is associated with ototoxicity, leading to irreversible bilateral sensorineural 
hearing loss"
"This is caused by the production of toxic levels of reactive oxygen species 
resulting in in the inflammation and destruction of sensory outer hair cells in the inner ear"
"
Initially, hearing loss occurs at high frequencies (4,000 to 8,000 Hz) in the first cycle of 
cisplatin chemotherapy and worsens with subsequent cycles – hearing loss progression 
eventually impacts lower frequencies of hearing, impacting the ability to comprehend 
speech.4"
"
Hearing loss resulting from ototoxicity is a permanent and debilitating side effect of cisplatin 
chemotherapy in children"
"Infants and young children are at a critical stage of development 
in which hearing loss can negatively impact speech and language development and literacy, 
resulting in a life-long effect on quality of life (QoL).9"
"Caregivers of children with hearing 
loss also suffer from an increased burden of care which can be severely detrimental to their 
quality of life and wellbeing"
"Childhood hearing loss is also associated with a severe 
economic burden due to the costs of management strategies, additional educational support 
and productivity losses"
"
Pedmarqsi is a water-soluble thiol compound which is administered via a 15-minute 
intravenous infusion, six hours after the completion of every cisplatin infusion"
"The 
mechanism of action is not completely understood but may work through increasing levels 
of endogenous antioxidants, inhibition of intracellular oxidative stress, and/or a direct 
interaction between cisplatin and the thiol group in Pedmarqsi in ear fluid, where cisplatin 
becomes trapped (the latter produces an inactive platinum species which is not cytotoxic 
and is readily excretable)"
"
Pedmarqsi is licensed for the prevention of ototoxicity induced by cisplatin chemotherapy in 
patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with localised, non-metastatic, solid tumours"
"
Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity develops in approximately 60% (26% to more than 90%) of 
children receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy, resulting in a devastating life-long 
impact"
"Approximately 222 patients in England and Wales with non-metastatic, localised 
cancer per year are expected to receive cisplatin chemotherapy and meet the eligibility 
requirements for preventative treatment with Pedmarqsi"
"
Additionally, Pedmarqsi, a novel, anhydrous formulation of sodium thiosulfate, is the first 
and only preventative treatment developed for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"There are no 
options for preventative treatment, with the current treatment pathways consisting only of 
non-preventative management strategies once ototoxicity has occurred – inclusive of 
interventions such as hearing aids and cochlear implants"
"Existing options do not address 
the underlying cause of hearing loss, and do not restore the hearing function or QoL of 
children with hearing loss to the levels associated with normal hearing"
"Therefore, 
there is a severe unmet need for a preventative treatment option such as Pedmarqsi"
"

Mechanism of action  
Pedmarqsi (Na2S2O3.5H2O) is a water-soluble thiol compound with 
reducing agent properties and is a normal metabolite in humans 
and other mammals"
"Following intravenous (IV) injection, 
Pedmarqsi is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid; up to 
95% is excreted unchanged in the urine and the biological half-life 
is 0"
hours
"The mechanism of action of Pedmarqsi is not fully 
understood, but may include increasing levels of endogenous 
antioxidants, inhibition of intracellular oxidative stress, and direct 
interaction between cisplatin and the thiol group in Pedmarqsi in 
ear fluid, where cisplatin becomes trapped"
"The latter produces 
an inactive platinum species which is not cytotoxic and is readily 
excretable"
"
 
Concurrent incubation of Pedmarqsi with cisplatin decreased in 
vitro cytotoxicity to tumour cells; delaying the addition of Pedmarqsi 
to these cultures prevented the protective effect"

"
Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity overview 
Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy widely used to treat a variety of cancers in 
children and young people"
"It remains one of the most effective chemotherapy treatments for 
childhood cancer and is a key component in the treatment of solid tumours, in particular, 
intracranial and intraspinal tumours, ependymoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, 
hepatoblastoma, osteosarcoma, malignant germ cell tumours, and nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma"
"
A leading concern for the use of cisplatin chemotherapies within a paediatric population is the 
development of irreversible hearing loss due to cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"Cisplatin 
triggers hearing loss in three major tissue areas within the cochlea: the organ of Corti, spiral 
ganglion cells and the lateral wall (stria vascularis and spiral ligament)"
"The production of toxic 
levels of reactive oxygen species at these locations leads to the inflammation and destruction 
of sensory outer hair cells, resulting in widespread cochlear damage"
"The extent of this 
damage is exacerbated by the prolonged presence of cisplatin in the inner ear, facilitated by 
the blood-labyrinth barrier"
"
Ototoxicity initially presents as bilateral, high-frequency (4,000 to 8,000 Hz) sensorineural 
hearing loss, which may occur in the first cycle of treatment and once acquired, tends to 
worsen with increasing cumulative doses of cisplatin, extending to lower frequencies which 
relate to speech"
"It should be noted that in current clinical practice, especially in younger 
patients, early presentation of hearing loss can be missed – see further details in Section 
B.1.3.1.2"
"Risk factors for more severe hearing loss include younger age at exposure (under 
five years) and a high cumulative dose of cisplatin (> 400 mg/m2)"
"
For the comparison to Pedmarqsi, there are currently no treatments that prevent the onset of 
ototoxicity in children who are being treated with platinum-based chemotherapy"
"Whilst there 
are several different options available for managing hearing loss once it has developed, the 
quality of these management interventions are incomparable to the maintenance of natural 
hearing"
"As such, an unmet need remains for a protective treatment that can prevent cisplatin-
induced hearing loss and improve QoL for survivors of childhood cancer"
"

 
B.1.3.1"
"
Diagnosis of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a paediatric population 
As cisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy are 
monitored for ototoxic hearing loss using pure-tone audiometry (PTA) assessments"
"Typically 
monitoring is performed using baseline and serial PTA measurements within a conventional 
frequency range of 0"
to 8 kHz
"Loss of hearing at these frequencies is indicative of cisplatin-
induced hearing loss"
"Ototoxicity monitoring is therefore essential for early identification of 
changes in hearing"
"
However, within current clinical practice, there is a frequent issue in delayed diagnosis"
"The 
impact of ototoxicity often progresses undetected until a noticeable decline in hearing, 
particularly in the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension, becomes apparent"
"
Confirming that hearing loss has occurred can present issues as an accurate diagnosis 
requires a comparative baseline audiometric measurement pre-ototoxic drug"
"Issues in the 
collection of such baseline measurements can lead to delay in confirming whether a child has 
experienced hearing loss and therefore results in a delayed diagnosis"
"
Once diagnosed that ototoxic hearing loss has occurred, the extent of decline in hearing can 
be qualified"
"Variable factors impact the severity of both the measurable hearing loss and the 
impact it has on QoL experienced"
"Notable factors include the age at exposure, with a younger 
age correlating to more severe impact of hearing loss, and the cumulative dosage of cisplatin 
received, with a greater expose to cisplatin correlating to a more severe impact of hearing 
loss"
"
Determining what constitutes a significant change in hearing is essential to qualify the severity 
of the decline"
"Within the existing literature, there are a range of systems which can be used 
to define severity"
"For example, in COG ACCL0431, a pivotal Pedmarqsi trial, the American 
Speech Language and Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria is used and this defines a 
significant change in hearing as either a 10 dB change from baseline at two consecutive 
frequencies, or a 20 dB change at one frequency, or loss of measurable hearing for three 
consecutive frequencies where there was previously measurable hearing"
"Whereas in 
SIOPEL 6, another of Pedmarqsi’s core clinical trials, the Brock scale is used to assess 
hearing loss"
"The Brock scale is one of the most widely used paediatric-specific ototoxicity 
scales and was specifically designed to evaluate paediatric patients treated with cisplatin, 
focusing on high frequencies"
"Hearing loss Grades 0-4 are assigned based on standard pure-
tone audiograms and reflect absolute hearing loss as opposed to a shift from baseline"
"
The use of the Brock system is particularly helpful for very young children where an accurate 
baseline assessment may not be feasible"
"
Beyond the gradings used within Pedmarqsi’s core clinical trials, a study published by Orgel 
et al"
"(2023)32 (identified in the systematic literature review (SLR)) and discussed in Section 
B.2.7), reports the use of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Boston 
classification as an alternative measure of hearing loss"
"This scale was developed as a 
measure to report hearing outcomes in international clinical trials for paediatric patients treated 
with platinum therapy, taking into account the functional outcome of a patient at the end of 
treatment"
"Furthermore, additional ototoxicity grading systems have been developed which 
are noted below: 
 
 

 
• 
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) scale requires a baseline evaluation before treatment initiation and 
subsequent evaluations to measure change in hearing level as treatment progresses"
"
• 
The Chang criteria was developed as a modification of the Brock scale, resulting in a 
more clinically-sensitive assessment correlating with the expected course of treatment-
induced ototoxicity in clinical trials"
"
The grading criteria used in the ototoxicity classification systems described above are 
compared in Table 3"
"As shown, there are differences in the thresholds for each grade of 
ototoxicity between the grading systems"
"Some of the variability in reported incidences of 
ototoxicity is therefore due to the inconsistencies in the assessment and grading tools"

"
Epidemiology 
Pedmarqsi is indicated for the prevention of hearing loss in patients treated with cisplatin 
chemotherapy"
"As such, the eligible population is not a single specific disease population (i.e"
"
a single type of cancer), but a subpopulation of children diagnosed with tumours that are 
treated with cisplatin"
"Therefore, disease prevalence is not simply defined"
"Additionally, 
Pedmarqsi is considered to be administered for a period of less than one year given that 
cisplatin treatment would also not be expected to be given beyond 12 months (see Section 
B.3.3.1.1)"
"
Given these two factors, an incidence statistic (i.e"
"the identification of new cases who would 
undergo cisplatin treatment), as opposed to a prevalence statistic, is considered the most 
representative method to identify the population of interest"
"
To present an epidemiology statistic, calculations (summarised in Table 4) take the number of 
newly diagnosed paediatric cancer cases from 2012 to 2016, showing there to be an average 
of 470 solid tumour cancer cases recorded in children and adolescents (those aged under 18 
years) in England and Wales every year"
"From this it can be said that, on average, 69.4% 
(min: 56%, max: 90%) of these patients will present with non-metastatic, localised, disease at 
the point of diagnosis"
"Of this cohort, it is assumed that 70% of annual diagnosed localised 
patient will be treated with a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy"
"As such, it is estimated that 
there will be an eligible population for Pedmarqsi in England and Wales of 222 patients – this 
should therefore be considered a ‘very rare’ patient population"

"
bWithin the reference for the number of newly diagnosed tumours, the data are grouped into age categories which do not suit the indication for Pedmarqsi"
"As such, the number 
diagnosed aged 0-19 years (sourced from the CTYA cancer incidence statistics)35 is multiplied by the proportion of children aged under 18 within the under 19 age category 
(sourced from the ONS),36 to calculate the number diagnosed aged 0-18 years"

"
dIt is anticipated that only a proportion of paediatric patients with localised cancers will receive a chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin and therefore be eligible for

B.1.3"
"
Burden of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity 
B.1.3.2"
"
Clinical burden 
Approximately 60% (26% to more than 90%) of children receiving cisplatin-based treatments 
will develop irreversible ototoxicity, resulting in a devastating life-long impact for these 
patients"
"Hearing loss resulting from this ototoxicity is a permanent and debilitating side 
effect of cisplatin chemotherapy"
"If a patient experiences high-frequency hearing loss, this 
renders certain consonants (f/th/p/k/h/t) inaudible and therefore infants and young children 
who are at a critical stage of development, will experience a negative impact on both their 
speech and language development and literacy skills"
"In older children and adolescents, 
high-frequency hearing loss has been reported to impact on educational achievement, social-
emotional development, and QoL"
"
Alongside development and social-emotional impacts, up to 75% of paediatric patients with 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss become eligible for hearing aids or auditory support"
"Even with 
hearing aids or auditory support, cancer survivors with hearing loss experience abnormal 
hearing, tinnitus, compromised speech comprehension in noisy settings, social challenges, 
and significant financial burden"
"Whilst there are existing management strategies for those 
experiencing hearing loss, using such medical devices is inferior, in terms of patients’ QoL, to 
the prevention of hearing loss altogether"
"
B.1.3.2"
"
Quality of life burden 
As described above, the hearing loss induced by cisplatin ototoxicity is a side effect that can 
severely hinder the QoL in children"
"A child is at increased risk of academic difficulty, social 
and emotional problems, and fatigue in the learning environment from even minimal hearing 
loss in frequency ranges above 2,000 Hz"
"In general, the younger the child is when hearing 
loss develops, the more significant the impact on speech and language development, however 
hearing loss also impacts the educational achievement and emotional wellbeing of older 
children"
"
Hearing loss is particularly detrimental in younger (pre-lingual) children, as language 
development and general learning are dependent on hearing, the development of verbal and 
communication skills, comprehension ability and social development are all hindered.11,39"
"In 
school-aged children, problems such as poor academic performance, emotional development 
and self-esteem/behaviour issues commonly arise"
"In adolescents and young adults social 
isolation, depression and the inability to live independently are often reported"
"
Regardless of age, those with hearing loss have reported feeling excluded in social settings, 
having social fatigue and because of these issues, preferring to avoid such social situations"
"
Such anxiety frequently leads to social exclusion and individuals feeling isolated within their 
social networks"
"Prolonged social exclusion can lead to depression and other mental health 
concerns which can be severely detrimental to the patient"
"
Whilst the indicated population for Pedmarqsi is that of people aged under 18 years, the impact 
of ototoxic hearing loss is irreversible, and therefore lifelong"
"Among a study of adults, who 
were survivors of childhood cancer and who suffer from treatment-induced hearing loss, 45% 
had never married (compared to 37.9% for the general population) and 34% were unemployed 
(compared to 5.3% for non-disabled adults) or had not graduated high school.43"
"The 

 
challenges of hearing loss can also lead to anxiety and depressive symptoms amongst 
survivors"
"
Beyond patients, the caregivers of patients with hearing loss experience a quality of life 
burden"
"Parents and teachers are reported to face difficulties dealing with the communicative, 
behavioural, and social consequences of childhood hearing impairment"
"Communication 
between the caregiver and the child may be poorly established, creating frustration for both 
parties"
"Children with hearing impairment are also more susceptible to behavioural issues, 
which may create or increase stress for the parents and caregivers"
"Additionally, hearing 
impairment can hinder a child’s psychosocial development and social skills, collectively 
contributing to heightened parental psychological distress"

Patient perspectives from FDA Patient-Focused Drug Development 
Program: Voice of the Patient Report - Childhood Cancer Hearing Loss 
As summarised from the literature in the above Section B.1.3.2.2, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity 
presents a significant QoL burden to patients and their caregivers"
"In addition to the referenced 
publications, data are available from a published document titled “The Voice of the Patient: 
Childhood Cancer Hearing Loss” which covers details of a public meeting conducted as part 
of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) patient focused drug development initiative"
"
The outputs of the meeting echo the key messages presented in Section B.1.3.2"
"(as well as 
section B.1.3.1"
"which covers limitations with currently available management strategies); 
however, given the importance of the patient perspective and the severe impact hearing loss 
has on patients, this report is described in greater detail below"
"
The Patient-Focused Drug Development meeting was hosted in 2018 by four advocacy 
organisations in childhood cancer to share insights with researchers and senior officials at the 
US FDA, as well as other chemotherapy-induced paediatric hearing loss stakeholders 
presenting the perspectives of people living with chemotherapy-induced hearing loss"
"The 
cause of hearing loss was mostly related to the use of platinum-based chemotherapy in 
childhood and the vast majority of children had at least moderate hearing loss"
"The meeting 
aimed to assess the impact on patient’s daily lives, and their expectations and priorities for 
both current and future ototoxic induced hearing loss treatments"
"
Key impacts identified in the meeting were the unprecedented impacts on their day-to-day 
lives, and deterioration in their mental health"
"
Day-to-day impacts were reported across a significant list of categories, inclusive but not 
limited to; socialisation, learning and academic experiences, employment opportunities, 
participation in sports, recreational activities, performing arts, and general quality of life, 
indicating the burden of the disease upon their daily lives"
"To the point on socialisation, 
following the loss of their hearing, many described the development of severe social isolation 
coupled with anxiety when participating in social situations both in school, and in their adult 
lives"
"
In broader terms, some older patients in the group expressed that their hearing loss had been 
so impactful, they wished that their cancer had not been treated"
"One patient stated that due 
to the hearing loss they were experiencing, they discontinued their chemotherapy to preserve 
what hearing they had left"
"
To support the above impacts, the following quotes from the meeting from cancer survivors 
with hearing loss are presented to help build the story of impact: 

 
• 
“Before my hearing loss, I was a happy, active, extroverted child"
"Now I’m too anxious 
or exhausted to enjoy new environments or activity"
"I am a lonely and typically anxious 
person"
I’m a different person because of my hearing loss
"I’ve told my parents many 
times that I wish I didn’t go through my cancer treatment because of my hearing loss, 
it makes life difficult and unbearable.” 
• 
“It’s hard to pick one thing that worries me the most"
"One day, it might be missing 
something that other people my age are doing…Overall, my biggest worry about my 
hearing is it makes my world so much smaller.” 
Following from statements such as those above, the advocacy organisations also included 
discussions with patient caregivers, who expressed fears that their children would continue to 
withdraw from the world: 
• 
“The hearing loss…is the single reason that he says, ‘I wish the cancer had killed me.’ 
He thinks that the life we gave him by saving his life isn’t worth it right now.” 
• 
“He works so hard to try be independent, but he finds workplace options lacking 
because of his hearing.” 
Beyond reporting perspectives on what the patient experiences in terms of living with hearing 
loss, the meeting also gathered insights into how patients currently perceive their management 
of deafness following cisplatin treatment"
"Whilst patients use a variety of management 
devices, they state their effectiveness to be limited, and note significant disadvantages 
associated with each modality"
"
• 
Hearing aids were most widely deployed as a strategy to improve hearing following 
loss, however participants reported several disadvantages, including that they do not 
work well in noisy environments and they can fail due to battery drain or breakage as 
well as being uncomfortable, both physically and socially"
"
• 
Whilst systems are in place within the educational system, e.g"
"FM systems, they are 
dependent on the compliance of teachers"
"Additionally, feeding into prior points on 
mental health impacts, these systems often make patients feel like they stand out as 
not only a person with poor hearing, but also a consistent self-reminder that they are 
a cancer survivor"
"
• 
Finally, there were also those who were using cochlear implants"
"Many reported them 
to be extremely invasive, requiring a complete destruction of what remains of their 
natural hearing, leaving full reliability to the management device"
"Additional concerns 
were raised on their links to migraines and skin sensitivity"
"
Overall, a key conclusion and message from participants in these meetings was the significant 
unmet need for treatments that can prevent hearing loss, and the lack of effective treatment 
options currently available for patients"
"
B.1.3.2"
"
Economic burden 
The hearing loss associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity presents a significant economic 
burden"
"Approximately 60% of children with moderate hearing loss require additional 
individualised tutoring from a specialist teacher for the deaf"
"The vast majority of children 
with severe or profound hearing loss also require additional educational support, such as 

 
specialist schooling or tutoring"
"Extra teaching support represents a substantial resource use 
in England and Wales"
"
The typical approach for children judged to have moderate or severe hearing loss is to provide 
them with a hearing aid"
"It is reported that the typical cost of a high-frequency digital hearing 
aid is £250-300 per pair; these are replaced every four years and may also require additional 
amplification technology"
"Children suffering from profound hearing loss typically have a 
bilateral cochlear implant costing approximately £41,000 with the requirement for external 
processor replacement being every five years and costing approximately £5,800"
"In 
addition, frequency modulation (FM) systems are provided in classrooms to assist all children 
with hearing loss"
"The cost of a binaural FM system is estimated to be approximately 
£2,30014; these systems are typically replaced every five years"
"
Aside from the costly expense associated with treating hearing loss, there is a considerable 
economic strain on the NHS linked to its management, including costs for hearing 
assessments and speech and language therapy"
"In addition, patients with marked and 
severe hearing loss are also less likely to be able to gain employment, with a relative reduction 
in work of 24% observed compared to the general population of England and Wales"
"
Finally, carers of children with hearing loss are impacted by the disease, facing challenges 
such as missed employment opportunities and reduced productivity due to attendance of 
medical appointments with physicians and specialists"
"
B.1.3"
"
Current treatment pathway 
B.1.3.3"
"
Treatment options 
There are no existing pharmacological interventions for the prevention of hearing loss caused 
by cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, despite the significant impact hearing loss has on patients"
"
Current guidelines for the management of ototoxicity resulting from cisplatin chemotherapy 
include monitoring the level of hearing loss which, in some cases, is used to inform switching 
the platinum-based chemotherapy agent from cisplatin to carboplatin"
"Although carboplatin 
is less ototoxic than cisplatin, it has been reported that cisplatin is more effective at treating 
certain tumours, such as germ cell and liver malignancies"
"This trade-off between 
minimising the severity of acquired hearing loss whilst potentially compromising the efficacy 
of chemotherapy highlights the unmet need for a treatment to prevent cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity, so patients can confidently continue to take cisplatin to treat their underlying 
cancer"
"
For those continuing with a cisplatin-based treatment pathway, once hearing loss has 
occurred, the current management strategies involve the use of non-pharmacological 
interventions which are not preventative (cannot reverse hearing loss), and are of a quality 
incomparable to that of natural hearing"
"The most common management strategy for those 
with lesser severities of hearing loss is the use of hearing aids throughout a patient’s life"
"
Although hearing aids amplify sound, they indiscriminately amplify all sounds – reducing the 
patient’s ability to discriminate speech in noisy environments"
"Further issues with hearing 
aids include the fact that children are required to frequently recharge the batteries for them to 
function, they are easily lost or broken, and children may avoid wearing hearing aids altogether 
due to a perceived social stigma"
"Coupled to hearing aids, additional strategies can be used 
to further utilise the benefit of hearing aids, inclusive of auditory trainers, telephone amplifiers 
and audio streamers to enhance the effect of hearing aids in loud environments, however care 

 
must be taken to ensure compatibility between these devices and the specific model of hearing 
aid"
"As an additional concern, hearing aids must be replaced every four years and may also 
require additional amplification technology"
"Hearing aids are far less effective than approaches 
which protect a person’s natural hearing"
"
For those children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss who are unable to 
benefit from hearing aids, bilateral cochlear implants may be used"
"These provide a 
modified sense of sound but require commitment to an audiology and speech therapy 
rehabilitation programme"
"However, as with hearing aids, they present limitations inclusive of 
the need for external processors requiring replacement every five years, and the internal 
electrode also being at risk of requiring replacement due to device failure"
"
Finally, a third mainstream approach to hearing loss management in the UK, is the use of FM 
systems in classrooms to support all children with hearing loss in the education environment"
"
These devices allow the transmission of sounds (e.g"
"lessons in a classroom) directly to a 
child’s hearing device, however these systems typically need replacement every five years"
"
Given the lack of preventative pharmacological treatment options, Pedmarqsi remains the only 
potential option for patients to prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and avoid the suboptimal 
management strategies as described above"
"
B.1.3"
"
Place of Pedmarqsi in the treatment pathway 
The introduction of Pedmarqsi will represent a step change in the treatment pathway through 
access to a preventative intervention to avoid cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children with 
cancer"
"
To be eligible for Pedmarqsi, no additional testing beyond standard ototoxicity monitoring 
would be required"
"Therefore, the majority of patients who meet the eligibility criteria defined 
in the marketing authorisation for Pedmarqsi (i.e"
"patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with 
localised, non-metastatic, solid tumours who are receiving cisplatin chemotherapy) would be 
eligible for treatment"
"
The anticipated positioning of Pedmarqsi in England and Wales is summarised in Figure 1"
"

 
Figure 1: Proposed positioning of Pedmarqsi for cisplatin-treated paediatric patients in 
England and Wales 
Abbreviations: FM – Frequency modulation 
 
Pedmarqsi has demonstrated robust efficacy in terms of preventing cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss through the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 clinical trials"
"Both studies reported 
statistically significant results in hearing related outcomes favouring Pedmarqsi over cisplatin 
treatment without Pedmarqsi (Section B.2.5)"
"Further to this, Pedmarqsi does not impact the 
OS of cancer patients whilst demonstrating a safety profile which suggests the medicine is 
safe and generally well tolerated (Section B.2.10)"
"Therefore, the Pedmarqsi represents a safe 
and effective treatment that will benefit patients in terms of preventing cisplatin-induced 
hearing loss in children"
"
In addition, there is significant humanistic and economic burden associated with cisplatin-
induced hearing loss and the availability of Pedmarqsi will improve educational, social-
emotional, and QoL outcomes for survivors of childhood cancer, as well as removing the costs 
and perceived social stigma associated with assistive devices needed to manage the 
condition"
"
Therefore, the introduction of Pedmarqsi will fill a substantial unmet need for a treatment that 
can prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children, and the evidence confirms that 
Pedmarqsi should be made available as soon as possible for patients in England and Wales"
"
B.1"
"
Equality considerations 
Pedmarqsi is licensed for use in children 1 month to <18 years of age with localised, non-
metastatic, solid tumours to prevent hearing loss caused by cisplatin-based chemotherapy 

 
regimens"
"Preventing hearing loss from occurring, or the severity at which it does occur, is 
vital to enable children to reach their full potential"
"As established in Section B.1.3, once 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss has occurred, management strategies may be available but will 
not compensate for the irreversible damage to the inner ear caused by cisplatin, and are 
therefore not as effective in restoring patients’ QoL when compared to the prevention of 
hearing loss altogether"
"The introduction of Pedmarqsi for routine use will greatly improve the 
QoL, opportunities and prospects for children receiving cisplatin chemotherapy and surviving 
their childhood cancer"
"
Furthermore, although the NHS offers a basic service which includes hearing aids, patients 
requiring more advanced hearing aids may be forced to search elsewhere"
"This can shift the 
financial burden to parents and carers who will need to purchase these for their children"
"This 
inequity is further enhanced by household income, as families living in challenging financial 
and social conditions are less likely to be able to afford more advanced equipment and, more 
generally, have an increased burden when caring for a child suffering from hearing loss"
"
Finally, although speech and language therapy is offered by the NHS, wealthier families may 
pay for their children to have lessons with a better teacher-to-child ratio"
"Again, this creates 
an inequity where the prospects of a child with hearing loss are heavily impacted by household 
income"
"Pedmarqsi can have a positive impact on this inequity by offering a safe and effective 
treatment to prevent ototoxicity and therefore avoid hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin 
chemotherapy"
"
 

 
B"
"Clinical effectiveness 
Summary 
The clinical effectiveness of Pedmarqsi is demonstrated across two randomised, open-label 
clinical trials; the SIOPEL 6 trial and the COG ACCL0431 trial"
"Both trials compared the 
efficacy and safety of cisplatin with Pedmarqsi against cisplatin without Pedmarqsi in the 
prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in paediatric patients"
"
The SIOPEL 6 trial demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in its primary efficacy 
endpoint, the proportional incidence of children with Brock Grade >1 hearing loss after the 
end of treatment or at >3"
"years of age (whichever was later) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population"
"The proportion of children in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm with Brock Grade 
>1 hearing loss at age >3"
"years (20 children, 35.1%) was approximately one-half 
compared with the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (35 children, 67.3%)"
"The risk of 
experiencing hearing loss was statistically significantly lower in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi 
arm compared with the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (relative risk: 0.521, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.349, 0.778; p<0.001), corresponding to a clinically meaningful 
48% lower risk after Pedmarqsi treatment"
"
Pedmarqsi also reduced the severity of hearing loss in the SIOPEL 6 trial"
"Of children in the 
mITT population who experienced hearing loss of at least Brock Grade 1, 55% of children 
treated with Pedmarqsi experienced Brock Grade 1 hearing loss, 33% Grade 2, 6% Grade 
3 and 6% Grade 4"
"In comparison, 41% of children treated with cisplatin without Pedmarqsi 
experienced Brock Grade 1 hearing loss, 38% Grade 2, 18% Grade 3 and 3% Grade 4"
"
The COG ACCL0431 trial also demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in its primary 
efficacy endpoint, the proportional incidence of hearing loss between the cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi arm and the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm in the efficacy population"
"The 
proportion of children in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm with hearing loss (14 children, 
28.6%) was approximately one-half of the proportion of the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm 
(31 children, 56.4%)"
"The odds of having hearing loss as defined by ASHA criteria were 
statistically significantly lower in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm compared with the 
cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (odds ratio: 0.274; 95% CI: 0.114, 0.660; p=0.0039), when 
adjusted for the stratification variables of prior cranial irradiation (yes vs no), age subgroup 
(<5 years of >5 years), and duration of cisplatin infusion (<2 vs >2 hours)"
"
An additional post-hoc analysis of the COG ACCL0431 trial results published by Orgel et al"
"
(2023)32 using the more recent International SIOP ototoxicity scale also demonstrated that 
Pedmarqsi reduced the severity of hearing loss in the COG ACCL0431 trial"
"After the end 
of cisplatin treatment, a lower incidence of Grade >2 cisplatin-induced hearing loss occurred 
in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm (4.0%) versus the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm 
(27.1%)"
"In addition, it was concluded that the odds of developing SIOP Grade >2 cisplatin-
induced hearing loss were significantly lower for patients in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm 
(odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.50, p=0.005)"
"The same pattern was seen for SIOP 
Grade >1; a lower incidence of Grade >1 cisplatin-induced hearing loss occurred in the 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm versus the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (18.0% versus 
45.8%; OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.64, p=0.004)"
"
Patients receiving Pedmarqsi experienced adverse events (AEs) at a similar rate as those 
who did not receive Pedmarqsi in both the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials, 
demonstrating that Pedmarqsi is safe and generally well tolerated"
"

 
Neither trial demonstrated that Pedmarqsi affected the OS of patients, suggesting that 
Pedmarqsi does not affect the efficacy of cisplatin as a chemotherapy treatment for the 
underlying tumour when administered 6 hours after the end of a cisplatin infusion lasting no 
more than 6 hours"
"
Overall, the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials represent a comprehensive evidence 
base and demonstrate the robust clinical efficacy and safety of Pedmarqsi in preventing 
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in patients 1 month to < 18 years with localised, non-metastatic, 
solid tumours"

Identification and selection of relevant studies 
A SLR was conducted to identify relevant literature regarding the efficacy and safety of 
treatments for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children"
"Full details of the 
methodology of the SLR are presented in Appendix D"
"List of relevant clinical effectiveness 
evidence"
"
The SLR identified two clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Pedmarqsi for 
the prevention of ototoxicity in children: the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials"
"
• 
SIOPEL 6 was a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised trial assessing the 
efficacy and safety of delayed Pedmarqsi infusion in reducing ototoxicity in 129 
children"
"These children were receiving single agent cisplatin therapy for the treatment 
of standard-risk hepatoblastoma (defined as pre-treatment tumour extension 
[PRETEXT] classification I, II or III, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >100 μg/L, and no 
additional PRETEXT criteria)"
"
• 
COG ACCL0431 was a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised trial assessing 
the efficacy of delayed Pedmarqsi infusion for preventing hearing loss in 131 children"
"
These children were receiving cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens for the 
treatment of newly diagnosed germ cell tumour, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, 
neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or any other solid malignancy treated with cisplatin"

Summary of methodology of the relevant clinical 
effectiveness evidence 
B.2.2"
"
The relevance of reporting Pedmarqsi doses in anhydrous form 
It should be noted that in the following sections, where the dose of Pedmarqsi is referred to, 
the dose reported is the anhydrous dose"
"This is because the active ingredient of Pedmarqsi 
is anhydrous sodium thiosulfate"
"Additionally, this aligns with the GB Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for Pedmarqsi, which reports the recommended dose in anhydrous 
form"
"However, it should be noted that the clinical study reports (CSR) and publications for 
the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials report the dose of Pedmarqsi in pentahydrate-
equivalent form (due to an existing US monograph for a pentahydrate form of sodium 
thiosulfate) and therefore do not align with the SmPC"
"As this discrepancy is due to the higher 
molecular mass of the pentahydrate form compared to the anhydrous form of sodium 
thiosulfate, it should be noted that the amount of active ingredient for a given dose is the same 
regardless of whether it is hydrated or anhydrous"
"For clarification, a conversion table between 
the doses for the pentahydrate-equivalent and anhydrous forms of Pedmarqsi used in the 
SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 clinical trials is presented below in Table 7"
"To avoid any 
potential ambiguity, the approved formulation in both GB and EU is anhydrous"

SIOPEL 6 trial methodology 
The SIOPEL 6 trial was an open-label, phase III randomised trial performed at 52 centres 
across 12 countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Switzerland, 
Spain, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Japan"
"
The primary objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy of Pedmarqsi for reducing hearing 
impairment caused by cisplatin chemotherapy"
"
The secondary objectives were to: 
• 
Monitor any potential impact of Pedmarqsi on the child’s response to cisplatin and 
subsequent survival"
"
• 
Assess the short- and long-term tolerability of the combination of Pedmarqsi and 
cisplatin"
"
• 
Prospectively evaluate and validate biological, radiological and pathological features 
of standard-risk hepatoblastoma for future risk adapted management"
"
During the screening phase, children were randomised 1:1 to receive Pedmarqsi after each 
cisplatin dose (cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm) or to receive cisplatin without Pedmarqsi"
"This 
randomisation was stratified by country, median age (above vs below 15 months), and 
PRETEXT classification (I and II vs III)"
"A total of 129 children were registered, 114 of which 
were randomised in the study: 61 children in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and 53 children 
in the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm"
"Of the 15 children registered but not randomised: 13 
children were withdrawn due to unspecified reasons; one child was withdrawn due to parental 
consent; and one child was withdrawn due to ineligibility (for details of the SIOPEL 6 exclusion 
criteria, see Table 8)"
"Although the trial was open-label due to the emergence of treatment-
related side effects during infusion, blinded assessment of the primary endpoint was feasible 
and thus offsets any introduction of bias resulting from open-label trial status"
"
During the treatment phase, children received preoperative chemotherapy including four 
courses of cisplatin with or without Pedmarqsi (dependent on their randomisation status) on 
Days 1, 15, 29, and 43, followed by surgery, and received two additional chemotherapy 
courses postoperatively (on Days 1 and 15 post-surgery)"
"If surgery was delayed for any 
reason, two further courses may also have been given (on Days 57 and 71)"
"
In the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm, six hours following each cisplatin dose, children received 
Pedmarqsi by intravenous (IV) infusion"
"The design of the SIOPEL 6 trial is summarised in 
Figure 2"
"

"
Interventions 
As noted above, Pedmarqsi was administered as a 15 minute IV infusion, six hours after 
cisplatin (maximum dose cisplatin: 80 mg/m2)"
"Pedmarqsi doses correspond to the body 
weight of the child (>10 kg, 5 to 10 kg, and <5 kg received Pedmarqsi 12"
"g/m2, 9"
"g/m2, and 
6"
"g/m2, respectively (anhydrous dosing)"
"
Analysis of the safety population concluded that the mean cumulative cisplatin exposure was 
similar between the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi and cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arms (363"
"
mg/m2 vs 362"
"mg/m2, respectively)"
"
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was the proportional incidence of hearing loss defined as Brock Grade 
≥1 hearing loss determined by PTA after the end of treatment or at age ≥3"
"years (whichever 
timepoint was later)"
"The Brock Grade of the better ear was used for analysis of hearing 
impairment in the primary endpoint"
"Hearing impairment rates were calculated and compared 
between the two randomised treatment groups"
"As a method of censoring patients, children 
without a hearing loss assessment were counted as a failure (i.e"
"had hearing loss) in this 
analysis"
The handling of missing data is further discussed in Section 0
"
The following key secondary endpoints were measured: 
• 
Hearing loss measurements: Pure-tone audiograms were performed by an 
experienced audiological technician"
"The resulting audiogram was uploaded through 
the Consorzio Interuniversitario (CINECA) remote data entry website"
"A central 
audiology reviewer accessed the CINECA remote data entry and graded the 
audiogram by providing a Brock Grade (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)"
"
• 
Percentage of children per disease status: Complete remission, partial remission, 
stable disease, progressive disease (all relating to the underlying cancer), and children 
who were not evaluable (presented overall and by randomised group)"
"
• 
Event-free survival (EFS): this was measured from the time of randomisation to the 
first of the following events: progression, relapse, second primary malignancy, or death 
(all relating to the underlying cancer)"
"
• 
Overall survival: this was calculated from the time of randomisation to death (relating 
to the underlying cancer)"
"OS was graphically compared between the randomised 
groups by Kaplan-Meier plots"
"A stratified log-rank test was calculated and stratified 
by the stratification factors used for randomisation"
"The hazard ratio between the two 
groups was calculated by stratified Cox regression and was presented together with 
its asymmetrical 95% CI"
"
• 
Satisfactory renal clearance: defined as a calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (a value less than this was considered as being of clinical concern)"
"

 
• 
The log10 change in AFP from baseline to any later assessment as well as the 
change from nadir to a higher value (indicative of tumour progression) were evaluated 
on a per child level as a biomarker assessment of hepatoblastoma response and 
remission status"
"
SIOPEL 6 concomitant medicines 
Cisplatin is a highly emetogenic drug, therefore patients frequently experience significant 
levels of nausea and/or vomiting"
"Pedmarqsi is also reported to be a highly emetogenic drug, 
hence concomitant antiemetic therapy was considered essential"
"The anti-emetic regimen was 
scheduled such that a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and other antiemetics (i.e"
"dexamethasone 
with chlorpheniramine and/or metoclopramide) were given 30 minutes prior to Pedmarqsi 
treatment"
"Sites were encouraged to administer children a multi agent anti-emetics lasting six 
to eight hours for the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment and adequate anti-emetic treatment was 
to be continued as long as required"
"
The following medications are known to be ototoxic and were prohibited where possible to 
avoid additional sources of ototoxicity during cisplatin treatment: amikacin, aminoglycosides, 
aspirin, bumetanide, desferroxamine, ethacrynic acid, erythromycin (give intravenously), 
furosemide, gentamycin, hexachlorobenzene, interferon alpha 2 therapy, kanamycin, 4-
methylthiobenzoic acid (interacts with platinum-based medication), mercury (if ingested), 
mitomycin (topical), neomycin, norvancomycin, propylthiouracil, quinine, streptomycin, 
streptidine, styrene, super oxides (Paraquat), teicoplanin, tirapazamine, paracetamol, 
vancomycin, and vincristine"
"
SIOPEL 6 supportive therapies 
Cisplatin-related supportive therapies remained the same irrespective of whether Pedmarqsi 
was also administered"
"A careful record of fluid input and output was kept during administration 
of each treatment cycle"
"If the child’s diuresis fell below 3 mL/kg/h for 2 hours, the hospital 
was to give the child a bolus of mannitol 0"
g/kg over 15 to 30 minutes
"The use of loop 
diuretics such as furosemide were to be avoided, as they are ototoxic"
"Serum electrolytes, 
especially serum sodium, were monitored daily prior to Pedmarqsi treatment and at 1, 6, and 
18 hours post-Pedmarqsi treatment"
"If the child’s serum sodium exceeded 150 mmol/L at one-
hour post-Pedmarqsi treatment, then the patient was to receive a bolus of mannitol 0"
"g/kg 
over 15 to 30 minutes with a 10 mL/kg fluid bolus of dextrose in addition to standard cisplatin 
hydration"
"Oral magnesium supplements were also given to all children (if necessary) between 
cycles"

COG ACCL0431 trial methodology 
The COG ACCL0431 study was a multicentre, open-label, phase III randomised trial in the 
United States and Canada investigating the efficacy of Pedmarqsi infusion (six hours after the 
completion of each cisplatin infusion) for preventing hearing loss in children"
"
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pedmarqsi infusion (following 
cisplatin treatment), compared with the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm, for preventing 
hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
germ cell tumour, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or any 
other malignancy treated with cisplatin"
"
The secondary objectives were to: 
• 
Compare the mean change in hearing thresholds from baseline to four weeks after 
treatment with cisplatin for key frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8,000 Hz) 
between the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm"
"
• 
Compare the incidences of cisplatin-related Grade 3 and 4 nephrotoxicity and Grade 
3 and 4 cytopenia between the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"

 
• 
Monitor EFS and OS relating to the underlying cancer in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi 
arm and the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm"
"
• 
Evaluate the association of two key gene mutations (thiopurine S-methyltransferase 
and catechol-O-methyltransferase) with the development of cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss (however, no analysis was conducted due to an insufficient number of samples)"
"
Children were randomised to either the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm or to the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"A total of 131 children were enrolled in the study across 38 sites in the US 
and Canada; data was provided from a total of 125 eligible children"
"The randomisation was 
stratified by prior cranial irradiation (yes vs no); and for children without prior cranial irradiation, 
randomisation was further stratified by age (<5 years vs ≥5 years) and duration of cisplatin 
infusion (<2 hours vs ≥2 hours)"
"Similar to SIOPEL 6 (see B.2.2.2), randomisation was blinded 
for central reviewers of audiometry data, but the study was open-label for children and treating 
physicians"
"
Cisplatin was administered according to the sites’ disease-specific cancer treatment protocols 
in use at the time, without specification by the COG ACCL0431 study with regard to individual 
or cumulative cisplatin dose, schedule, number of cycles, other chemotherapy administered, 
infusion rate or associated hydration/mannitol diuresis"
"When multiple daily doses of cisplatin 
were scheduled, there must have been at least a 10-hour delay before beginning of the 
subsequent cisplatin infusion following Pedmarqsi infusion"
"Furthermore, all cisplatin 
infusions must have been completed within 6 hours"
"
Children completed follow-up audiograms at four weeks and one year after completion of the 
planned treatment regimen"
"Children who discontinued Pedmarqsi prematurely before 
completion of the planned treatment regimen also completed audiograms at four weeks and 
one year after completion of the planned treatment regimen"

Interventions 
Pedmarqsi was administered by IV infusion over 15 minutes, beginning six hours after the 
completion of each cisplatin infusion"
The Pedmarqsi dose was 10
"g/m2 on each day it was 
administered (anhydrous dosing)"
"
Analysis of the safety population concluded that the mean cumulative cisplatin exposure for 
the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi and cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arms were 337"

"This difference is reflected in the differences observed in the 
number of cisplatin cycles received in each treatment arm (3"
"in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi

"
Outcomes 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportional incidence of hearing loss between the 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm, measured in the 
efficacy population"
"For the primary analysis, hearing loss was treated as a dichotomous 
variable measured using the ASHA criteria for hearing loss via comparison of the baseline

"A logistic regression model was used to evaluate if there 
was any association between Pedmarqsi treatment and hearing loss when adjusting for the 
stratification variables"
"The odds ratio with associated 95% CI and p-value for the between 
treatment comparison was estimated based on the logistic regression model"
"Similarly, 
subgroup analyses were performed for hearing loss by age group (<5 or ≥5 years)"
"These 
analyses were based on logistic regression, including only the treatment as a fixed effect in 
the logistic regression model and the odds ratio with associated 95% CI and p-value for the 
between treatment comparison was estimated"
"
The following secondary efficacy endpoints were measured: 
• 
The mean change in hearing thresholds for key frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 
and 8,000 Hz) between the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"Linear regression analyses were used to assess whether Pedmarqsi 
treatment reduced the mean change in hearing thresholds when adjusting for 
stratification variables"
"
• 
EFS and OS: Kaplan-Meier curves (and corresponding 95% CI) of EFS/OS for the two 
arms were estimated"
"As exploratory analyses, EFS and OS between the two arms 
were compared using log-rank tests"
"These analyses were performed at each 
scheduled interim monitoring assessment during accrual and in follow-up after accrual 
was completed"
"Exploratory analyses of EFS/OS outcomes using Cox models with 
randomisation stratification as covariates were also performed to test the influence of 
each covariate on EFS and OS"
"

 
• 
For the secondary analyses related to toxicities, presence of toxicity was treated as a 
dichotomous variable"
"Incidence of Grades 3 and 4 nephrotoxicity and the incidence 
of Grades 3 and 4 cytopenia between the two arms were compared using logistic 
regression with adjustment for the stratification variables"
"
COG ACCL0431 concomitant medicines 
Anti-emetics were indicated to prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy and 
Pedmarqsi"
Concurrent administration of loop diuretics (e.g
"ethacrynic acid, furosemide, and 
bumetanide) and/or aminoglycosides with cisplatin were to be avoided, if possible, because 
concurrent usage could have increased the risk of ototoxicity"
"If concurrent administration of 
these agents with cisplatin was indicated, administration information was recorded on 
standardised report forms"
"
COG ACCL0431 concomitant therapies 
Cranial irradiation was permissible prior to study enrolment, however, children receiving 
cranial irradiation were only eligible if their baseline pre-study audiometry was normal"
"The 
baseline audiometry must have been performed after cranial irradiation and prior to cisplatin 
chemotherapy"
This primarily applied to older children with medulloblastoma
"Children may 
have received cranial irradiation following completion of all systemic cisplatin chemotherapy 
provided their post end of treatment audiometry was completed prior to beginning irradiation"
"
This primarily applied to infants and toddlers with medulloblastoma treated on non-COG 
therapeutic studies"
"Cranial irradiation may not have been administered following study 
enrolment unless the child had completed all systemic cisplatin chemotherapy"
"
It was also recognised that children requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplants may have 
been exposed to further ototoxic medication"
"For these children, following an induction phase 
that contained cisplatin, it was noted that high-dose carboplatin could have been used in some 
conditioning regimens"
"Details of carboplatin administration during the transplant conditioning 
were recorded on standardised report forms"

Statistical analysis and definition of study groups in the 
relevant clinical effectiveness evidence 
SIOPEL 6 trial statistical analysis and definition of study groups 

 
Study groups 
The following populations were defined in the SIOPEL 6 trial, wherein the ITT population was 
the primary population for the efficacy analyses and the safety population was the primary 
population for all safety analyses: 
• 
ITT population (N=109; cisplatin without Pedmarqsi=52, cisplatin with Pedmarqsi=57): 
The ITT population comprised all randomised children except those for which informed 
consent was withdrawn prior to start of study treatment and those for whom study 
treatment would have been inappropriate because they had were subsequently 
diagnosed with high-risk hepatoblastoma, regardless of whether or not study 
medication was administered"
"
• 
Safety 
population 
(N=109; 
cisplatin 
without 
Pedmarqsi=56, 
cisplatin 
with 
Pedmarqsi=53): The safety population was defined as all randomised children who 
received at least one dose of study medication"
"
• 
mITT 
population 
(N=101; 
cisplatin 
without 
Pedmarqsi=46, 
cisplatin 
with 
Pedmarqsi=55): The mITT population consisted of children in the ITT population for 
whom the primary endpoint “hearing impairment after the end of treatment or at >3"
"
years of age (whichever was later)” was measured and the Brock Grade was 
adjudicated by the central audiology reviewer (i.e"
"children for whom an assessment 
of the primary endpoint could not be made were excluded from the mITT population)"
"
• 
PP (per protocol) population (N=105; cisplatin without Pedmarqsi=52, cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi=53): The PP population was defined as all children who were in the ITT 
population and, if randomised to the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm, had received at 
least one Pedmarqsi dose"
"
Statistical methods 
Continuous variables (e.g"
"age) were summarised using descriptive statistics (the number of 
children with available data, the mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and 
maximum)"
Categorical variables (e.g
race) were summarised using counts and percentages
"
Percentages were calculated using the total children per treatment group"
"All statistical tests 
performed were 2-sided and at the 5% significance level"
"
Primary hypothesis 
The hypothesis tested was a reduction of the rate of hearing loss from 60% in the cisplatin 
without Pedmarqsi arm to 35% in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm"
"
Sample size and power calculation 
The primary hypothesis was tested with a Chi-square test with significance level of 5% and 
power of 80%, which required a sample size of 102 evaluable children"
"The ITT population 
therefore had ≥80% power to detect an absolute reduction in hearing loss of 25% in the 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"In addition, the relative risk of hearing loss in both randomised treatment arms 
was calculated alongside an exact 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.5% confidence limit to 
97.5% confidence limit)"
"

 
Missing data 
For all populations, if the definitive assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint at >3"
"years 
of age was not available, the reason for the missing data informed the decision on how to 
handle the missing information"
"If the hearing assessment was not feasible due to the 
condition of the patient, then the patient was excluded from the analysis of the endpoint"
"This 
included patients who died before the assessment could have been done"
"If the hearing 
assessment was not done due to a logistical problem (e.g"
"the site failed to organise the 
hearing assessment), then the result was not imputed, and the patient was excluded from the 
primary analysis of hearing impairment"
"Sensitivity analyses using the complete mITT and PP 
populations were performed to analyse the effect of the missing data"
"
B.2.3"
"
COG ACCL0431 trial statistical analysis and definition of study 
groups 
Study groups 
The following populations were defined in the COG ACCL0431 trial, wherein the ITT 
population was the primary population for assessment of survival parameters, the safety 
population was the primary population for all safety assessments, and the efficacy population 
was the primary population for the analyses of hearing loss endpoints: 
• 
ITT population (N=125; cisplatin without Pedmarqsi=64, cisplatin with Pedmarqsi=61): 
The ITT population included all children who were randomised"
"This population was 
the primary population for the analysis of EFS and OS"
"
• 
Safety 
population 
(N=123; 
cisplatin 
without 
Pedmarqsi=64, 
cisplatin 
with 
Pedmarqsi=59): The safety population included all children who received at least one 
dose of cisplatin without Pedmarqsi or cisplatin with Pedmarqsi"
"Children were 
analysed according to the treatment received"
"
• 
Efficacy population (N=104; cisplatin without Pedmarqsi=55 cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi=49): The efficacy population included all children in the ITT population who 
had both baseline and 4-week follow-up hearing assessments"
"This population was 
the primary population for the analyses of the hearing loss endpoints"
"
Statistical methods 
Analyses were performed using SAS® version 9"
or higher
"For primary efficacy analysis, a 
logistic regression model was used to evaluate if there was any association between 
Pedmarqsi treatment and hearing loss when adjusting for the stratification variables"
"The odds 
ratio with associated 95% CI intervals and p-values for the between treatment comparison 
was estimated based on the logistic regression model"
"For the comparison of mean change 
in hearing thresholds between the two arms, hearing threshold was treated as a continuous 
variable and the mean change in hearing thresholds from baseline to the 4-week follow-up 
evaluation was compared between the two arms for five key frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 
4000 and 8,000 Hz)"
"Linear regression analyses were used to assess whether Pedmarqsi 
treatment reduced the mean change in hearing thresholds when adjusting for stratification 
variables"
"Analyses were performed individually for each key frequency; no multiple 
comparison adjustment was made for these analyses"
"Hearing data were collected and 
reviewed by two different blinded central reviewers"
"

 
Primary hypothesis 
The primary hypothesis was that there would be a 50% relative reduction in the proportion of 
children with hearing loss in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm versus the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"
Sample size and power calculation 
Sample size estimation was based on the primary efficacy endpoint"
"The incidence of hearing 
loss in the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm was assumed to be 45% and a treatment effect of 
Pedmarqsi with a 50% reduction in hearing loss for the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm was 
hypothesised, i.e"
a 22.5% hearing loss rate in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm was assumed
"
Assuming a one-sided significance level of 5% (as it was expected that hearing loss frequency 
would not increase in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm), 54 children per arm were needed to 
achieve 80% power for detecting a 50% reduction in hearing loss"
"
Missing data 
Children who dropped out of the study were not replaced, and missing data were not imputed"
"
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the ITT population with the assumption that patients 
without a valid hearing assessment had lost their hearing"
This is discussed later in B.2.5.2
"
B.2"
"
Critical appraisal of the relevant clinical effectiveness 
evidence 
A complete quality assessment of the evidence informing the clinical effectiveness of 
Pedmarqsi is provided in Appendix G"
"
B.2"
"
Clinical effectiveness results of the relevant studies 
The following results presented for the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials are those 
relevant to hearing loss (i.e"
"those relevant to the scope of the appraisal and included in the 
economic modelling)"
"The secondary outcomes of the studies which are related to tumour 
progression, such as EFS, are not related to hearing loss and therefore have not been 
reported in this submission as they are not relevant to the scope of the appraisal and were not 
used in the economic modelling"
"However, these results are available in both the SIOPEL 6 
(Brock et al"
2018)52 and COG ACCL0431 (Freyer et al
"2017)26 key publications and in the 
relevant CSRs"
"Results of the OS secondary outcomes have been reported for both studies, 
as OS is used in the economic modelling to inform mortality"
"
B.2.5"
"
SIOPEL 6 trial clinical effectiveness results 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the SIOPEL 6 trial strongly supported the effectiveness of 
Pedmarqsi in preventing hearing loss and reducing the severity of hearing impairment caused 
by cisplatin chemotherapy"
"This is shown by the reduction in the proportion of children 
experiencing Brock Grade >1 hearing loss from 67.3% in the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm, 
to 35.1% in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm"
"
OS results also showed that there was no statistically significant difference in mortality in 
children treated with Pedmarqsi compared to those who were not"
"

 
Primary efficacy endpoint: proportional incidence of children with Brock Grade >1 
hearing loss 
As described in SIOPEL 6 trial methodology, the primary efficacy endpoint was the 
proportional incidence of children with Brock Grade >1 hearing loss, measured by PTA, after 
the end of treatment or at >3"
years of age (whichever was later)
"Based on analyses in the 
ITT population, the proportion of children in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm with hearing loss 
at age >3"
"years (20 children, 35.1%) was approximately one-half compared with the cisplatin 
without Pedmarqsi arm (35 children, 67.3%)"
"The probability of experiencing hearing loss was 
statistically significantly lower in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm compared with the cisplatin 
without Pedmarqsi arm (relative risk: 0.521, 95% CI: 0.349, 0.778; p<0.001), corresponding 
to a clinically meaningful 48% lower risk after Pedmarqsi treatment"

By removing the children who did not experience hearing loss (i.e"

COG ACCL0431 trial clinical effectiveness results 
The results of COG ACCL0431 show that Pedmarqsi treatment was effective in the prevention

"Based on analyses in

The results of a sensitivity analysis for hearing loss conducted in the ITT population are 
presented in Table 18 and support the conclusion that Pedmarqsi is effective in preventing 
hearing loss"
"As described in COG ACCL0431 trial statistical analysis and definition of study 
groups, the ITT population contained all patients who received cisplatin without Pedmarqsi or 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi treatment, regardless of whether they had a follow-up assessment at 
4-weeks post-treatment or not"
"These results therefore demonstrate that even when patients 
without 4-week follow-up data are included as patients with hearing loss, the odds of having 
hearing loss (as defined by the ASHA criteria) were statistically significantly lower in the 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm (26 children, 42.6%) compared with the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm (35 children, 57.4%)"

Secondary efficacy endpoint: mean change in hearing thresholds 
As described in COG ACCL0431 trial statistical analysis and definition of study groups hearing 
data corresponding to the secondary efficacy endpoint were collected and reviewed by two 
different blinded central reviewers"
"For both the left and right ears, there were no significant 
differences in the change in hearing threshold from baseline to 4 weeks after cisplatin 
treatment for frequencies ≤ 2000 Hz between the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and the 
cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm"
"Greater differences were observed in the cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi arm compared to the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm at frequencies ≥ 4,000 Hz 
for both the left and right ears for both reviewers, with less hearing loss observed for the 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm than the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm at the higher 
frequencies"

COG ACCL0431 subgroups 
The COG ACCL0431 trial carried out a pre-planned subgroup analysis on the proportion of 
children with cisplatin-induced hearing loss who were <5 years of age compared to those >5 
years of age as children under 5 years are more susceptible to hearing loss, especially at high 
frequencies, since they have hearing that has not yet been subjected to normal age-related 
decline"
"The odds of having hearing loss as defined by ASHA criteria were statistically 
significantly lower in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm compared with the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm for children <5 years of age (odds ratio: 0.099; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.551; 
p=0.0082) and were numerically lower for children >5 years of age (odds ratio: 0.458; 95% CI: 
0.178, 1.180; p=0.1058)"

"The post-hoc 
analysis was performed by an audiologist investigator blinded to randomised allocation"

To replicate the COG ACCL0431 trial primary endpoint, hearing endpoints from COG 
ACCL0431 were re-evaluated using hearing loss at the end of cisplatin therapy and prior to 
autologous bone marrow transplantation"
"Hearing thresholds of SIOP Grade ≥2 and Grade ≥1 
were evaluated"
"
Following repeat audiological central review, 121 of 125 (97%) of patients were evaluable for 
hearing loss using the SIOP scale"
"After the end of cisplatin treatment, a lower incidence of 
Grade >2 cisplatin-induced hearing loss occurred in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm (4.0%) 
versus the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (27.1%)"
"In addition, it was concluded that the 
odds of developing SIOP Grade >2 were significantly lower for patients in the cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi arm (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.50, p=0.005)"
"The same pattern was seen for SIOP 
Grade >1; a lower incidence of Grade >1 cisplatin-induced hearing loss occurred in the 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm versus the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm (18.0% versus 
45.8%; OR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.64; p=0.004)"

Results from this re-analysis of hearing outcomes from the COG ACCL0431 trial confirm the 
otoprotective effects of Pedmarqsi using the SIOP Ototoxicity Scale"

SAEs were only reported for patients in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm and were defined as 
AEs that fulfilled the Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS) requirement"
"A 
total of 21 children (35.6%) in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm experienced at least one SAE"
"
The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (12 children [20.3%]), neutrophil count 
decreased (10 children [16.9%]), platelet count decreased and white blood cell count 
decreased (both eight children [13.6%]), and anaemia (seven children [11.9%])"
"A total of six 

 
children (10.2%) experienced SAEs that were determined to be related to Pedmarqsi"
"These 
were related to blood and lymphatic system disorders (anaemia and febrile neutropenia), 
investigations (alanine aminotransferase increased and lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet and 
white blood cell count decreased), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, colitis, 
nausea, stomatitis and vomiting)"
"
Although the COG ACCL0431 trial did not specifically report discontinuations due to AEs, it 
has been noted that one patient in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm discontinued due to 
reasons related to a Grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction, and an additional four children 
discontinued Pedmarqsi in close proximity to an AE but not specifically due to an AE"
"No 
additional fatal AEs were observed during the trial, demonstrating that Pedmarqsi was well 
tolerated by patients in this study and had a safety profile similar to that of cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi"
"
B.2"
"Ongoing studies 
There are no ongoing studies that will provide additional evidence, in the next 12 months, for 
Pedmarqsi in the indication being appraised within this submission"
"
B.2"
"Interpretation of clinical effectiveness and safety evidence 
Clinical effectiveness 
As presented in Section B.2.5, the clinical study programme demonstrated the robust efficacy 
of Pedmarqsi in preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children"
"In the ITT populations 
of both the SIOPEL 6 trial (relative risk = 0.521; p <0"
"[Table 12]) and the COG ACCL0431 
trial (odds ratio = 0.411; p = 0"
"[Table 18]), statistically significant reductions in the 
proportion of patients who experienced hearing loss when treated with cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi compared to treatment with cisplatin without Pedmarqsi were reported"
"
In addition, the results of the SIOPEL 6 trial demonstrated that the hearing loss experienced 
by children receiving Pedmarqsi alongside cisplatin chemotherapy is less severe than hearing 
loss experienced by those receiving cisplatin without Pedmarqsi (Table 15)"
The Orgel et al
"
(2023) re-analysis of the COG ACCL0431 study supported this finding"
"
Thus, the results of both trials demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of Pedmarqsi in reducing 
the proportional incidence of hearing loss (i.e"
"the prevention of hearing loss) and reducing 
the severity of hearing loss in those patients who still develop the condition, for cisplatin-
treated children"
"
Safety 
The safety evidence demonstrates that in both SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 trials, 
Pedmarqsi was safe and generally well tolerated"
"As presented in Section B.2.10Adverse 
reactions, the nature and frequency of AEs reported in children receiving Pedmarqsi in 
conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy was similar to those observed in children having 
cisplatin chemotherapy without Pedmarqsi"
"The similarities between the safety profiles of 
cisplatin with Pedmarqsi and cisplatin without Pedmarqsi provide evidence in support of a 
favourable benefit-risk assessment for Pedmarqsi in the treatment of cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity"
"

 
Of note, the cisplatin renal and haematological toxicity observed was similar between the 
treatment arms in both studies"
"This lends support to the notion that Pedmarqsi preferentially 
targets the auditory system"
"If Pedmarqsi had a broader spectrum of action and interacted 
with cisplatin it would have been reasonable to expect a decrease in the toxicity of other 
system organs that are known to be adversely affected by cisplatin"
"
Strength of the clinical evidence 
SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 represent two well-conducted, randomised, controlled clinical 
trials"
"Pedmarqsi demonstrated robust clinical effectiveness in both trials, with statistically 
significant reductions in a clinically meaningful and highly relevant endpoint – the proportional 
incidence of hearing loss"
"Furthermore, the populations studied in both trials were highly 
relevant to the indication for Pedmarqsi and the scope for this HTA, as both trials were carried 
out in populations of children receiving cisplatin aged >1 month to <18 years"
"In addition, 
comprehensive adverse event data were also collected in both trials, allowing robust safety 
assessments of Pedmarqsi to be made"
"Lastly, both studies confirmed that Pedmarqsi 
administration six hours post cisplatin infusion, when cisplatin infusions last no longer than 6 
hours, did not affect the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy in treatment of the underlying 
cancer"
"
Limitations of the clinical evidence 
One limitation of the COG ACCL0431 trial was that the ASHA criteria (described in Section 
B.1.3.1.2), used to assess hearing loss, does not assess the severity of the acquired hearing 
loss, only whether the patient’s hearing levels meet a certain threshold"
"However, it is noted 
that the scale was selected because at the time of the study, it was regarded as the most 
sensitive scale available to assess hearing loss"
"This issue was addressed in the SIOPEL 6 
trial, which used the Brock scale, specifically developed for measuring cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity and by Orgel et al"
"(2023)32 who re-evaluated COG ACCL0431 endpoints according 
to the SIOP Ototoxicity Scale"
This study is further discussed previously in Section B.2.7
"
The sample size for both trials was relatively small (SIOPEL 6, n=114; COG ACCL0431, 
n=125)"
"However, due to the nature of cisplatin ototoxicity as a very rare disease, this is a 
limitation of the available number of children to recruit for clinical trials and thus is to be 
expected"
"In addition, this concern is also offset by the availability of two randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) with similar outcomes, implying that a comprehensive evidence base is available 
for the assessment of Pedmarqsi in a relevant patient population"
"
Conclusion 
As outlined in Section B.1.3.3, there are no existing treatments for the prevention of cisplatin-
induced hearing loss in the current treatment pathway"
"The current management of hearing 
loss involves the use of non-pharmacological interventions which are not preventative and 
cannot reverse hearing loss"
"In addition, current management options are suboptimal and not 
as effective at restoring QoL when compared to prevention"
"
A comprehensive evidence base is available through the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 
studies to support the use of Pedmarqsi as an effective and safe treatment for the prevention 
of hearing loss in the relevant indication"
"Pedmarqsi is therefore able to address the unmet 
need for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and support children in reaching their 
full potential and leading fulfilling lives"
"Pedmarqsi will also be the first and only licensed 
treatment for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children with localised, solid 

 
tumours in England and Wales, and therefore will represent a step change in the clinical 
pathway for the prevention of ototoxicity in patients treated with cisplatin"
"
 
 
 

 
B"
"Cost effectiveness 
Summary 
A de novo economic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of Pedmarqsi 
in cisplatin-treated paediatric patients aged 1 month to <18 years of age with localised, non-
metastatic, solid tumours"
"The model is cohort-based and has five hearing loss health states 
based on the Brock grading scale used in SIOPEL 6; Minimal/no hearing loss (HL), Mild HL, 
Moderate HL, Marked HL and Severe HL, with an absorbing state for Dead"
"Patients enter 
the model and are said to experience or not experience measurable hearing loss, as 
presented through assignment to either the Minimal/no HL health state or one of the hearing 
loss severity health states (Mild HL, Moderate HL, Marked HL, Severe HL)"
"From year two 
onwards, patients either stay in their respective health states for the remainder of the model 
time horizon or move to the Dead state"
"
In the base case, clinical inputs of the model were based on COG ACCL0431 trial data as 
the distribution of tumour types within this study can be considered generalisable to the 
relevant patient population in England and Wales"
"Utilities were sourced from a study which 
assessed the HRQoL of children by hearing loss severity"
"A cancer disutility was applied to 
all health state utilities to ensure they were reflective of patients undergoing cisplatin 
treatment"
"Unit costs were sourced from the NHS Cost Collection, Personal Social Services 
Research Unit (PSSRU), and the electronic Market Information Tool (eMIT), or where not 
available, from published literature sources"
"Resource use was sourced from published 
literature"
"The model structure and inputs were validated with external clinical and health 
economics and outcomes research experts"
"
Base case results show that at PAS price, cisplatin with Pedmarqsi is associated with a 
QALY gain of 1"
"compared to cisplatin without Pedmarqsi, and this benefit is associated 
with an incremental cost of £xxxxxxxxx"
"This results in an ICER of £xxxxxxxxx, which is 
below NICE’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained"
"Uncertainty 
was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis"
"One-way sensitivity 
analysis (OWSA) results showed that the model results were most sensitive to changes in 
the percentage of patients with Minimal/no hearing loss in both treatment arms of the model"
"
The mean probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) ICER was within xx of the base case ICER, 
highlighting the robustness of model results"
"Probabilistic scenario analyses explored the 
structural uncertainty of the model, and in 11 out of 15 scenarios explored, cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi remained cost-effective against the WTP threshold of £30,000"
"
 

 
B.3"
"
Published cost-effectiveness studies 
A 
SLR 
was 
conducted 
to 
identify 
relevant 
economic 
evaluations 
for 
the 
prevention/management of patients with acquired hearing loss"
"This population was expanded 
from the population criteria in the clinical search (which aligned with the licensed indication of 
Pedmarqsi) as it was determined that economic evidence in patients with hearing loss 
acquired through other causes (besides cisplatin-induced ototoxicity) and in patients of all age 
groups may be relevant to inform the economic modelling due to the lifetime horizon applied 
and the lack of economic data in the specific licensed population"
"Because of this, the non-
clinical SLR included, but was not confined to, patients with cisplatin-induced hearing loss, 
whereas the clinical SLR was limited to the licensed indication only of cisplatin-induced 
hearing loss"
"A detailed description of the review methods and results are reported in Appendix 
G"
"
Following this expanded search, a total of 13 cost-effectiveness references were identified as 
part of this SLR which provided economic evidence for the prevention/management of 
acquired hearing loss"
These studies are summarised in Table 27

Economic analysis 
No published economic evaluations of Pedmarqsi were identified in the cost-effectiveness 
SLR (see Section B.3"
and Appendix G)
"Therefore, a de novo cost-effectiveness model 
structure was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of cisplatin with Pedmarqsi versus 
cisplatin without Pedmarqsi"
"Whilst there are no previous NICE evaluations of preventative 
treatments for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, the NICE appraisal of cochlear implants for 
children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss (TA566, formerly TA166) should be 
considered relevant through its status as a NICE TA which partially captures the Pedmarqsi 
label through its assessment of hearing loss in children"
"HTE6 was also identified which is a 
NICE health technology evaluation which evaluated a genetic test for the prevention of 
paediatric hearing loss"
"Whilst this is also not entirely aligned to the patient population under 
consideration in this submission, elements of the analysis are relevant due to it being a NICE 
evaluation for hearing loss in paediatric patients"
"Therefore, these economic evaluations were 
used alongside publications identified within the economic SLR to inform the de novo model 
structure, assumptions, and data sources"
"
B.3"
"
Patient population 
The cost-effectiveness analysis presented considers cisplatin-treated patients aged 1 month 
to <18 years of age with localised, non-metastatic, solid tumours"
"This is in line with the 
population in the pivotal trials SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431,16,25 the final scope issued by 
NICE,60 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) marketing authorisation for Pedmarqsi,15 
and Food and Drug Administration prescribing information"
"
B.3.3"
"
Model structure 
The de novo cost-effectiveness model was developed in Microsoft Excel® (version 2311; build 
17029.20068) using both deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo simulation) frameworks"
"
In the first year, the model structure is that of a cohort-based decision tree (Figure 8)"
"The 
model structure has five hearing loss health states based on the Brock grading scale used in 
SIOPEL 6 (Described in Section B.1.3.1.2, Table 3); Minimal/no HL, Mild HL, Moderate HL, 
Marked HL and Severe HL, with an absorbing state for Dead"
"
Patients enter the decision tree in the Minimal/no HL health state and by the end of year one 
they are said to experience measurable hearing loss or not, as presented through transitioning 
to one of the hearing loss severity health states (Mild HL, Moderate HL, Marked HL, Severe 
HL), or remaining in the Minimal/no HL health state"
"From year two onwards, patients cannot 
transition between hearing loss health states and are only at risk of moving to the absorbing 
state for Dead (Figure 9)"
"
This model structure was selected based on the following reasons: 
• 
It best captures the efficacy data that is available for Pedmarqsi; the primary outcome 
of COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6 was the proportion of patients with hearing loss 
after the end of study treatment, as defined by the ASHA criteria (COG ACCL0431) or 
the Brock grading scale (SIOPEL 6)"
"

 
• 
The inability to revert to less severe hearing loss health states is representative of the 
fact that cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is permanent and irreversible"
"
• 
Similarly, patients are unable to move to more severe hearing loss health states over 
the time horizon"
"Whilst a degree of age-related hearing loss may be expected in the 
general population, including such an approach in the economic analysis would 
present challenges and increase uncertainty, given data are not available to capture 
the natural decline in hearing for the general population"
"It is also noted that general 
population hearing loss was not modelled in a previous NICE health technology 
evaluation, HTE6,59 which evaluated a genetic test for the prevention of paediatric 
hearing loss over a lifetime horizon"

"
Time horizon and cycle length 
The base case analysis adopts a ‘lifetime’ horizon of xxxx years (calculated as 100 minus the 
baseline age), which is considered long enough to adequately capture the lifetime costs and 
QoL of patients in this setting"
Section B.3.4
"provides more information about the baseline 
age in the model"
"
A cycle length of one year is selected because, on average, cisplatin treatment (and therefore 
Pedmarqsi treatment) is completed within one year"
"This was validated by clinician feedback 
and is also demonstrated by the total duration of treatment in COG ACCL0431 (median of 15 
weeks for patients across both treatment arms62)"
"This was validated by clinician feedback 
and is also demonstrated by the total duration of treatment in COG ACCL0431 (median of 15 
weeks for patients across both treatment arms61)"
"One year is also considered short enough 
to adequately capture and reflect changes in costs and QoL over the lifetime horizon"
"The 
model applies a half-cycle correction to account for uncertainty in the exact timing of transitions 
to the Dead state and thus the point at which patients no longer accrue costs and QALYs"
"
However, Pedmarqsi acquisition, administration and antiemetic premedication costs, as well 
as AE costs in both treatment arms were applied in the first cycle only to all patients entering 
the model and therefore a half-cycle correction was not applied for these"
"This is a 
conservative approach, which assumes that patients will incur these costs even if they move 
to the Dead state throughout the first cycle"
"
B.3.3.1"
"
Discount rate and perspective 
As per the NICE reference case, all health outcomes are measured in QALYs and a 3.5% 
discount rate per annum is used for QALYs and costs"
"The analysis is conducted from the 
perspective of the NHS and PSS for costs and health outcomes"
"
As scenario analyses, the model explores separate analyses using a discount rate of 1.5% for 
QALYs and costs, including education costs within the perspective, and including a wider 
societal perspective (education and productivity costs)"
"

 
B.3.3.1"
"
Features of the economic analysis 
There are no previous NICE evaluations for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, 
however the NICE appraisal of cochlear implants for children and adults with severe to 
profound hearing loss (TA566) may be considered relevant due to its status as a NICE TA 
assessing the management of hearing loss in children"
"Therefore this was used alongside 
publications identified within the economic SLR to inform the de novo model structure, 
assumptions, and data sources"
"The features of the economic analysis are summarised in

Intervention technology and comparators 
The intervention modelled in the analysis is Pedmarqsi"
"In line with the final scope, the 
identified comparator is “established clinical management without anhydrous sodium 
thiosulfate (Pedmarqsi)” as there are currently no other licensed treatments for the prevention 
of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"Therefore, the comparator in the model is cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy without Pedmarqsi treatment, as per the COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6 
clinical trials"
"
Pedmarqsi treatment is administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion, beginning six hours 
after the completion of each cisplatin infusion"
Pedmarqsi was dosed at 10
"g/m2 in COG 
ACCL0431"
"For children whose therapeutic protocol administered cisplatin on a “per kg” basis 
due to young age or small body size, Pedmarqsi was dosed at 341 mg/kg (anhydrous dosing)"
"
The dose of Pedmarqsi given in SIOPEL 6 was dependent on weight and reflected the dosing 
shown in Table 29 (expressed in anhydrous form):

"
Clinical parameters and variables 
As outlined in Section B.2.1, there are two clinical trials that have evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of Pedmarqsi for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"The principal source 
of clinical data used to inform the economic analysis is the COG ACCL0431 clinical trial as it 
included patients with a range of tumour types which were considered generalisable to the 
patient population in England and Wales (further discussed in Section B.3.4.1)"
"On the other 
hand, SIOPEL 6 was limited to patients with standard-risk hepatoblastoma with an average 
age of 1"
years
"As scenario analyses, clinical data from SIOPEL 6 is used"
"
Clinical data for the following inputs/endpoints/events are used to inform the estimation of 
costs and outcomes within the model: 
• 
Baseline characteristics (Section B.3.4.2) 
• 
Efficacy (Section B.3.4.3) 
o Proportion of patients experiencing hearing loss 
o Distribution of hearing loss severity 
• 
Safety (Section B.3.4.4) 
• 
Mortality (Section B.3.4.5) 
As defined in Section B.1.1, the approved licence for Pedmarqsi is within a cisplatin-treated 
paediatric population with localised solid tumours"
"However, it should be noted that whilst the 

 
 
COG ACCL0431 trial is the most generalisable to the UK setting (see Section B.3.4.1), it 
included patients with both localised and metastatic disease"
"The trial was designed as a 
hearing study and sought to include all children receiving cisplatin for any newly diagnosed 
solid tumour"
"
To ensure close alignment with the label population of Pedmarqsi, for the majority of clinical 
inputs in the economic model, data is sourced from the subgroup of patients with localised 
disease within COG ACCL0431"
"This includes baseline characteristics, mortality, and dose 
inputs"
"Use of mortality inputs for localised disease only is of particular relevance, as survival 
is known to be impacted by the extent of the cancer"
"However, there are some inputs where it 
was considered more robust and appropriate to use data from the full trial population (localised 
and metastatic)– specifically for AEs and treatment efficacy"
"
In terms of AEs, a patient’s underlying cancer prognosis will not be impactful to the safety 
profile associated with Pedmarqsi"
"Therefore, it is considered more robust to use data utilising 
the larger sample size of COG ACCL0431 to accurately reflect the impact"
"
Furthermore, for the primary endpoint – assessment of hearing loss, COG ACCL0431 was not 
powered for an analysis in the subpopulation of localised patients (n=33/55 children treated 
with Pedmarqsi)"
"This categorisation was not considered in the stratification variables at 
randomisation and therefore it is considered inappropriate to further restrict an analysis of 
treatment effect from an already limited population size"
"Further to this, Pedmarqsi is a 
treatment for the prevention of hearing loss, and not a treatment for the underlying cancer, 
and therefore the efficacy of Pedmarqsi in terms of hearing outcomes is independent of 
whether the patient has localised or metastatic disease"
"The limitations of this approach are 
further mitigated by the results of SIOPEL-6 trial, which corroborate the otoprotectant effect of 
Pedmarqsi in patients with localised disease, as well as Pedmarqsi’s mechanism of action 
being confined to the ear, as summarised in section B.1.2, and hence in terms of Pedmarqsi’s 
efficacy, there is no rational to consider any differentiation in effect based on tumour 
characteristics"
"
Accounting for the reasons above, to ensure presentation of a robust and clinically relevant 
economic model, the Company concluded it would be appropriate to use efficacy data which 
is powered by the overall COG ACCL0431 population"
"
B.3.4"
"
Generalisability of COG ACCL0431 to England and Wales 
COG ACCL0431 was a hearing study conducted in North America and included children with 
any solid tumour that is treated with cisplatin"
"The trial included paediatric patients with a range 
of cancer types which are generally aligned to the distribution of key cisplatin-treated 
paediatric localised cancers in England and Wales, as published in the CTYA UK cancer 
incidence 1997-2016 statistics,71 as shown in Table 30"
"
Whilst Table 30 presents slight differences between the proportions of tumours in the trial and 
those seen in the CTYA UK cancer incidence statistics, they can be explained through some 
of the more common localised cancers in the UK not always being treated with cisplatin"
"For 
example, retinoblastomas can sometimes be managed with surgery alone"
"Further, whilst 
none of the tumours appearing in the CTYA UK statistics were excluded from the COG 
ACCL0431 trial, the tumour types included in the trial are those which are treated with cisplatin 

 
 
most commonly"
"Most importantly, it should be remembered that Pedmarqsi is a preventative 
treatment of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"Its mechanism of action, when given 6 hours after 
cisplatin infusions that last no longer than six hours, is confined to the ear, and hence the 
underlying cancer type is not important"
"Finally it should be noted that to assess 
generalisability based on the distribution of cancer types, some assumptions were required to 
present 
comparable 
data; 
teratoid/rhabdoid, 
choroid 
plexus, 
astrocytoma 
and 
medulloblastoma cancers, which were listed in COG ACCL0431, were grouped into the 
intracranial and intraspinal tumours category, as they are all central nervous system (CNS) 
tumours"
"
COG ACCL0431 also includes patients of a wide range of ages, and hence a wide range of 
dose quantities required (as dose is weight based), which makes the study most generalisable 
to the eligible population of patients in England and Wales"
"Cancer treatment protocols in 
paediatrics are determined by collaborative groups who share information globally because of 
the challenges of conducting research in this area"
"Therefore, despite COG ACCL0431 being 
conducted in North America, the number of cisplatin doses (and therefore Pedmarqsi doses) 
used in the trial is anticipated to reflect what would be used in UK clinical practice"
"
As shown by the baseline characteristics of patients within COG ACCL0431 (reported in 
Section B.3.4.2, Table 31), the percentage of males within the trial is higher than that of the 
general population, however this aligns with published literature which shows that the 
incidence of many cancers is higher in men than women, including in the paediatric 
population.72"
"Therefore, given the above, the COG ACCL0431 trial is considered a robust 
data source and generalisable to UK clinical practice"

Efficacy 
The efficacy of Pedmarqsi is captured within the one year decision tree by two elements: firstly, 
the percentage of patients who experience cisplatin-induced hearing loss through the 
percentage of patients assigned to the Minimal/no HL health state, and secondly the severity 
of hearing loss for those that experience it, as depicted by the distribution of patients between 
the Mild HL, Moderate HL, Marked HL and Severe HL health states"
"
In the base case, the percentage of patients who experience cisplatin-induced hearing loss is 
based on the primary outcome of COG ACCL0431 measured in the efficacy population 
(Section B.2.5.2) and as discussed in Section 0 data from both localised and metastatic 
patients is used"
"The efficacy population is considered appropriate to use as it included all 
children in the ITT population who had both baseline and four-week follow-up hearing 
assessments and therefore an assessment of the change in hearing loss can be conducted"
"
This population was also the primary population for the analyses of the hearing loss endpoints 
in COG ACCL0431"
"As the efficacy population was pre-specified in the trial protocol,75 the 
Company consider any bias associated with this exclusion method to be minimal (as 
discussed by Rehman et al"
2020)

Safety 
The base case model considers Pedmarqsi treatment-related SAEs occurring in ≥2% of 
patients"
"The focus is on Pedmarqsi treatment-related AEs as it is assumed that cisplatin-
related AEs will be equal in both arms"
"The source for AE inputs aligns with the source of trial 
data used to inform the efficacy in the model; in the base case COG ACCL0431 AE rates are 
used (taken from the full safety population as discussed in Section 0) and as a scenario, 
efficacy inputs (and consequently AE inputs) are taken from the safety population in SIOPEL 
6"
"Note that in the base case, none of the treatment-related SAEs met the threshold of being 
observed in ≥2% of patients (and therefore no AEs are included in the base case analysis), 
and under the scenario where SIOPEL data is used, only one treatment-related SAE met the 
threshold (Neutrophil count decreased occurring in 3.77% of patients)"

Mortality 
The pivotal trials SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431, showed that there was no statistically 
significant difference between the proportion of children who died in the cisplatin with 
Pedmarqsi and cisplatin without Pedmarqsi treatment arms (see Section B.2.5)"
"As such, the 
mortality inputs of the cost-effectiveness model are not treatment dependent"
"
Despite mortality being equal between treatment arms, it is important to accurately capture 
the mortality for the population of interest as this impacts the average length of time that costs 
and QALYs are accrued for, and therefore the ICER"
"For the first five years of the model, 
mortality probabilities are based on the percentage of patients alive at years one, two, three, 
four and five of COG ACCL0431 and as discussed in Section 0, only data from localised 
patients is considered"
"

 
 
As a scenario, the OS results of SIOPEL 6 are considered (reported in Section B.2.5.1)"
"The 
five-year trial mortality probabilities are presented in Table 36"
"Mortality differs between COG 
ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6 due to each trial’s patient characteristics (notably, the tumour types 
and age of patients)"
"Where mortality percentages are less than that of the general population 
mortality, the general population values are used"

*Only data from localised patients is considered to align with the Pedmarqsi license"
"**Where mortality 
percentages are less than that of the general population mortality, the general population values are used"
"
As the OS data from both trials is immature, it is not appropriate to extrapolate these outcomes 
over the time horizon of the model"
"However, the Company acknowledge that beyond five 
years, patients are likely to still have an increased rate of mortality compared to that of the 
general population"
"A cure point of 10 years was preferred by the Committee in TA53877 and 
TA81778, both of which were oncology appraisals with comparable tumour types to those 
relevant to this appraisal (neuroblastoma and invasive urothelial cancer, respectively - for 
which the current standard of care [SoC] is platinum-based chemotherapy)"
"Therefore, from 
years six to 10 of the model, a post-cancer standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 9"
"is applied 
to general population mortality"
"The SMR was sourced from a large population based cohort 
study of five-year paediatric cancer survivors in England and Wales,79 whilst general 
population mortality was sourced from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)"
"Beyond model 
year 10, general population mortality data is applied"

Health-related quality-of-life studies 
An SLR to identify relevant HRQoL studies for patients with acquired hearing loss was 
conducted on 25th October 2023"
"This population was expanded from the population criteria 
in the clinical search (which aligned with the licensed indication of Pedmarqsi), and the 
reasons for this are described in Section B.3.1"
"Appendix H provides full details of the 
methods, overview of studies and results of the identified studies, together with the quality 
assessments"
"The SLR identified 38 utility studies, 10 of which reported HRQoL data by 
hearing loss severity level"
"Of these 10, seven were publications in adult patients or reported 
utility values derived from adult populations and therefore were less relevant to inform the 
utility values of the model"
"Of the remaining three studies, one study published by Oostenbrink 
et al"
"(2002) reported utility values for deafness and mild hearing loss only and therefore did 
not provide the level of granularity required for the model"

"
Targeted literature review 
To overcome the small number of publications found in the SLR that consider paediatric 
patients and report utilities according to hearing loss severity, a targeted literature search 
(TLR) for HRQoL in paediatric patients with hearing loss was conducted"
Barton et al
"(2006)63 
was identified through a TLR and was the main source of utility inputs for two of the SLR 
papers identified above"
"Although this study was not identified directly in the SLR, it was 
considered the most appropriate reference to inform health state utilities in the base case due 
to its close alignment with the population for which Pedmarqsi is indicated"
Barton et al
"(2006) 
was a cost-effectiveness analysis of cochlear implants in children with bilateral hearing 
impairment in the UK and included utility values for hearing loss categories by severity level"
"
The utility values used in this study were elicited using the Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3) 
utility measurement, which is an appropriate tool for assessing QoL in patients with hearing 
loss"
"
B.3.5"
"
Adverse reactions 
AE disutilities were sourced from published literature and were adjusted according to the 
duration that they typically last for (also sourced from published literature)"
"As detailed in 
B.3.3.1.1, all key paediatric cancer types are treated with cisplatin (and therefore Pedmarqsi) 
for no more than one year"
"Therefore, disutilities were applied to the percentage of patients 
experiencing each AE in the first year of the cost-effectiveness model only"
"
Incidence of AEs were obtained from the COG ACCL0431 clinical trial in the base case 
(Section B.3.4.4)"
"Table 37 includes the list of AE disutilities and durations included in the 
model"

mentioned in Section B.3.4.4, as none of the treatment-related SAEs met the threshold for 
inclusion in the base case"

Health-related quality-of-life data used in the cost-effectiveness 
analysis 
For the model base case, utility values were taken from Barton et al"
"2006, a cross-sectional 
study in which 8,876 hearing-impaired children had their HRQoL assessed by proxy from 
parents using the HUI3"
This is in line with the utility values used in Bond et al
"which 
was the basis of the economic evaluation within the HTA submission for cochlear implants for 
severe to profound deafness in both children and adults (TA566)"
"The Company understand 
that EQ-5D is NICE’s preferred generalised utility measure and that there are no HUI3 social 
preference weights available for the UK general population (only available for Canada and the 
US)"
"However it has been widely reported that EQ-5D lacks construct validity in patients with 

 
 
hearing impairment"
"The HUI3 is therefore the HRQoL measurement of choice in a 
population with hearing impairment,100,101 and is used by the UK cochlear implant study group 
(UKCISG) in research"
"For these reasons, the Company believe that HUI3 derived utility 
values are appropriate for this submission"
"
Barton et al"
"reported utility values of 0.677, 0.616, 0"
and 0
"for patients with 
Moderate (average hearing level [AHL] 40-70dB), Severe (AHL 71-95dB), Profound (AHL 96-
105dB) and Profound (AHL >105dB) hearing loss, respectively"
"These utility values were 
considered to be equal to the Moderate HL, Marked HL and Severe HL health states 
respectively (a weighted average of the profound utility values was used for the Severe HL 
health state, based on patient numbers in the publication)"
"For the Mild HL health state, utilities 
were calculated as an average of the Minimal/no HL health state (discussed later in this 
section) and the Moderate HL health state value mentioned above"
Barton et al
"also 
reported the utility gain associated with cochlear implant use for subsets of paediatric patients 
according to their age at implantation (<5 years and ≥5 years old) and duration of use"
"To 
align with the baseline age of the model (see Section B.3.4.2) and the assumption that once 
used, cochlear implant would be used by patients for their entire lifetime, the model utilises 
the cochlear implant utility gain reported for paediatric patients implanted over five years old 
and with a duration of cochlear implant use more than four years (utility gain of 0.183)"
"This 
was applied to each health state according to the percentage of patients using cochlear 
implants (as shown in Table 31)"
Barton et al
"included patients with moderate to 
profound hearing loss, therefore it was assumed that all patients not using cochlear implants 
would have received hearing aids, and therefore a hearing aid utility gain was not applied to 
the utility values reported for Moderate, Severe and Profound hearing loss"
"
A scenario analysis considering utility values from Gumbie et al"
was conducted
"
Disutility values for the bilateral mild hearing loss (-0.161), bilateral moderate hearing loss (-
0.323) and unilateral severe/profound hearing loss (-0.437) were used for the Mild HL, 
Moderate HL, and Severe HL health states"
"The Marked HL health state was calculated as an 
average of the Moderate HL and Severe HL health states"
"As in the base case, a utility gain 
for cochlear implants was applied, sourced from Barton et al"
2006
Gumbie et al
"also 
reported a utility gain for hearing aids of 0"
"therefore this was also applied to health state 
utilities according to the percentage of patients using hearing aids (as shown in Table 42)"
"
The utility values for the Minimal/no HL health state of the model were taken from Pogany et 
al"
"which is the source of the HUI3 population norms for the Canadian general 
population, reported on the HUI3 website"
"The utility reported for children aged 5-12 years old 
was used (0.920), as this is in line with the baseline starting age in the model"
"It is noted that 
there is likely to be small differences between the health preferences of the Canadian and UK 
general populations, however using a HUI3 value for the Minimal/no HL health state is 
appropriate given that HUI3 values are used for other health states, and as previously 
mentioned, there is no UK value set available for HUI3"
"This approach was also taken in a 
previous NICE health technology evaluation, HTE6"
"It is also of note that the HUI3 utility 
value used is not dissimilar from the UK general population EQ-5D utility value for people aged 
16 (the youngest age at which EQ-5D values are available);104 when the EQ-5D utility value is 
adjusted according to the gender distribution from COG ACCL0431, this results in a utility of 
0"
(only 1.2% higher than the HUI3 value of 0
used in the model)
"
Since the utility values from Barton et al"
(and Gumbie et al
"when used in the 
scenario) are not specific to cancer patients,63 it is likely that they represent an overestimation 
for the patient cohort considered within the cost-effectiveness analysis in the initial years 

 
 
following completion of their cisplatin treatment"
"Therefore, a cancer-related disutility was 
applied to all health states in the model for the first 10 years of the model, sourced from Chen 
et al"
"which is a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of health utilities in 
paediatric cancer patients"
"The HUI3 proxy-reported disutility value for patients on treatment 
was applied in the first year of the model, whilst between years two and 10 of the model, the 
HUI3 proxy-reported disutility for patients off treatment for 2-5 years was applied (no value 
was available for patients off treatment for 0-2 years)"
"The off treatment cancer-related 
disutility was applied up to year 10 of the model to align with the cure points reported in TA538 
and TA817,77,78 as described in Section B.3.4.5"
"This disutility value is only applied for this 
length of time to reflect that fact that utilities are likely to return to population norms after 
multiple years of being cancer free"

NICE guidance states that “If baseline utility values are extrapolated over long time horizons, 
they should be adjusted to reflect decreases in health-related quality of life seen in the general 
population”"
"Therefore utility values were age-adjusted over the model time horizon using 
the EQ-5D UK general population norms reported by the Decision Support Unit (DSU)"
"Male 
and female population utility norms were weighted according to the gender distribution in COG 
ACCL0431, to obtain overall population utility norms for each age"
"A multiplicative approach 
was used, meaning in each cycle, the EQ-5D derived utility norm for the average age of the 
cohort was compared to the EQ-5D derived utility norm of the baseline starting age of the 
cohort entering the model, and the percentage difference was applied to the baseline HUI3 
derived health state utilities mentioned above in Table 38"

Cost and healthcare resource use identification, 
measurement and valuation 
An SLR was undertaken to identify cost and resource use studies for the 
prevention/management of paediatric patients with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"This 
population was expanded from the population criteria in the clinical search (which aligned with 
the licensed indication of Pedmarqsi), and the reasons for this are described in Section B.3.1"
"
Appendix I provides full details of the methods, overview of studies and results of the identified 
studies, together with the quality assessments"

"
Intervention and comparators’ costs and resource use 
B.3.6.1"
"
Drug acquisition costs 
The cost of cisplatin was not considered in the economic analysis on the basis that it is equal 
between each treatment arm"
"
The Company presents a list price for Pedmarqsi based on the only available vial size of 8g"
"
Concurrent to the submission dossier, the Company has submitted a confidential simple 

 
 
discount Patient access scheme (PAS) for Pedmarqsi resulting in a fixed net price of 
£X,XXX.XX per 8g vial (equivalent to a discount of xx% to the list price)"
"
Pedmarqsi is administered as a 15-minute infusion, six hours after the completion of each 
cisplatin infusion (i.e"
Pedmarqsi is administered on a 1:1 frequency basis with cisplatin)
"
Therefore, the dose frequency of Pedmarqsi is dependent on the frequency of the patients’ 
cisplatin regimen"
"
The average per patient acquisition cost of Pedmarqsi in the model is based on the average 
number of doses per patient, and the average number of 8g Pedmarqsi vials required per 
dose, calculated from patient-level Pedmarqsi trial data"
"The source of data is aligned to the 
trial which is used to inform the efficacy in the model (previously presented in Table 32; COG 
ACCL0431 in the base case and SIOPEL 6 as a scenario)"
"Only data from localised patients 
is considered for dose inputs to align with Pedmarqsi’s licence"
"No dose modifications are 
recommended for Pedmarqsi"
"
As previously mentioned in Section B.3.4.1, despite COG ACCL0431 being conducted in 
North America, the number of cisplatin doses (and therefore Pedmarqsi doses) used in the 
trial is anticipated to reflect what would be used in UK clinical practice"
"
In the base case, it was conservatively assumed that no vial sharing is allowed and therefore 
full drug wastage is accounted for"
"Note that the number of vials required per dose, including 
wastage, is calculated on a per patient basis (as shown on the ‘ACCL0431 doses’ and 
‘SIOPEL doses’ sheet in the model) before being combined into an average for all patients 
within the trial, and therefore the number of vials is not a whole number even when wastage 
is included"
"Taking this approach to calculate wastage at the patient-level is considered 
more accurate than calculating wastage at the cohort level where the distribution of doses is 
not fully reflected"
"
In clinical practice, if only a small amount of a new vial is required, it is plausible that clinicians 
may not open the new vial after considering the cost and wastage associated with doing so"
"
This dose banding approach is supported by NHS England in chemotherapy dosing in order 
to reduce waste"
"The impact of assuming a dose banding approach was tested via scenario 
analyses which explored the impact of not costing for a new vial if less than 10% or 5% was 
required"
A further scenario of assuming no wastage was conducted
"
The mean number of doses and mean number of vials per dose (with and without wastage 
scenarios) are reported in Table 39"

Antiemetic premedication costs 
As specified in the Birmingham children’s hospital guideline for the management of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,106 antiemetic medication should be given to all 
children receiving cisplatin to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting"
"Similarly, 
the Pedmarqsi SmPC recommends that antiemetics are given around 30 minutes prior to 
Pedmarqsi administration to reduce the chance of nausea and vomiting"
"However, in practice 
is it unlikely that additional antiemetic medication would be required given that patients will be 
receiving multiple doses of antiemetic medication for their cisplatin infusion"
"For this reason, 
the costs of antiemetics are not considered in the economic model base case on the basis 
that they are equal in both arms and additional antiemetic medication is not required"
"However, 
a scenario analysis is provided which explores the impact of assuming one additional dose 
(on top of the antiemetics administered for cisplatin) of ondansetron, dexamethasone and 
metoclopramide prior to each Pedmarqsi administration"
"The choice of antiemetics is based 
on the Birmingham children’s hospital guideline for the management of chemotherapy-induced 
nausea and vomiting"
"The average weight used for the purpose of dose calculations aligns 
with the trial data used to inform the efficacy of the model (COG ACCL0431 (although localised 
only) in the base case and SIOPEL 6 as a scenario)"
"Unit costs and pack sizes were taken 
from the eMIT;107 where multiple pack sizes were available the most expensive option was 
used as a conservative estimate"

Administration costs 
As stated in the SmPC, Pedmarqsi is intended for hospital use only, under the supervision of 
an appropriately qualified physician, and should be administered intravenously as a 15-minute 
infusion"
"Due to the hypertonic formulation, administration through a central vein is 
recommended"
"
The Pedmarqsi administration cost includes 30 minutes of nurse time (15 minutes for infusion 
and 15 minutes for preparation), at a cost per hour of £106.00, which corresponds to hospital-
based nurse band 8c taken from the PSSRU"
"No cost of administration materials is included 
given that Pedmarqsi will not be commissioned by specialised services and that no additional 
equipment is required for administration or patient care"
"
Accounting for the average number of Pedmarqsi doses from the COG ACCL0431 and 
SIOPEL 6 trials (previously reported in Table 39), this equates to a total average administration 
cost per patient of £359"
and £280

Hearing loss management 
The costs and resource use corresponding to hearing aids, FM systems and cochlear implants 
are summarised in Table 42"
"Costs were sourced from the NHS Cost Collection 2021/202266 
and published literature (Cutler et al"
"TA566,58 Bond et al"
and Dionne et al
"
201214)"
"Whilst the Company understand that the preference is to extract cost data from the 
NHS Cost Collection, it was not always possible, so for costs associated with cochlear 
implants these were taken from Bond et al"
"(the cost-effectiveness analysis used to 
inform TA166 and subsequently TA566),58 and inflated from 2009 using the NHSCII"
"
Similarly, costs associated with FM systems were sourced from Dionne et al"
"inflated 
using the OECD CPI70 and converted to GBP using OECD PPP"
"Data for the percentage of 
patients requiring these management strategies were also sourced from published literature 
(Dionne et al"
Chorozoglou et al
2018110) and interviews with audiologists in 2018
"
Published literature shows that on average, hearing aids are replaced every four years, whilst 
FM systems are replaced every five years"
"Therefore from year two onwards in the model, 
an average annual costs is calculated for hearing aids and FM systems based on the 
replacement frequency, and applied to the percentage of patients requiring these 
management strategies in each health state"
"
A report from NHS England cochlear implantation services states that the external processor 
of a cochlear implant is replaced on average every five years to ensure the technology is kept 
up to date"
"Therefore from year two onwards in the model, an average annual cost is 
calculated for the external processor replacement, and applied to the percentage of patients 
requiring cochlear implants in each health state"
"However, Bond et al"
"reported that the 
external component of a cochlear implant is under warranty for free repairs/replacements for 
three years,48 therefore during the first three years from initial implantation, the model does 
not account for external processor replacement costs and only the annual maintenance and 
programming cost is applied"
"
Although not common, the internal component of a cochlear implant can sometimes fail which 
requires replacement and re-implantation"
"Analysis of internal device failure is commonly 
presented in the form of cumulative survival graphs which show the proportions of cochlear 
implants which survive to a particular point in time, as shown in Bond et al"
(Figure 11)
"
This graph was digitized and then used in the model to determine the probability of internal 
cochlear implants requiring replacement in each cycle of the model"
"Due to a lack of data 
being available after 40 years post initial implantation, a last observation carried forward 
approach was used whereby the probability of replacement in years 40+ of the model was 
assumed equal to the probability of replacement in year 40"
"Similar to the external 
components, the internal components are reported to be under warranty for 10 years,48 
therefore during the first 10 years from initial implantation, the model does not account for the 
cost of the internal electrode and only applies the costs associated with re-implantation"

"This included the cost of education and 
productivity losses for hearing loss patients and their parents (Table 46)"
"

 
 
Education costs were sourced from Chorozoglou et al"
"which reported the percentage of 
patients with moderate, severe and profound hearing loss attending various types of schools 
(mainstream schools, mainstream school with unit for deaf, special school for deaf, other 
special school, residential school), as well as the unit cost of each type of school"
"These 
values were used to inform the incremental education costs for the Moderate HL, Marked HL 
and Severe HL health states compared to the Minimal/no HL health state"
"As there was no 
resource use available for the Mild HL health state it was assumed that there was no 
incremental education cost for Mild HL patients compared to Minimal/no HL patients"
"
Education costs were applied to all patients aged five to 18, based on information on the 
Gov.uk school admissions website"
"
Chorozoglou et al"
"also reported the productivity loss for parents of patients with different 
hearing loss severities,110 which was used for the societal perspective scenario"
"The 
productivity loss of hearing loss patients once they reach working age was also included in 
the scenario, and was based on the expected relative reduction in work for patients (sourced 
Dionne et al"
"201214), and the average full-time and part-time salary in the UK (sourced from 
and the ONS117)"
The results of this scenario analysis are provided in Table 56
"Inclusion of 
education costs and not productivity costs was also included as a separate scenario, given 
that this represents a significant cost to Governmental bodies.

Severity 
Given the irreversible effects of cisplatin-induced hearing loss, coupled with the fact that 
cisplatin ototoxicity is a side effect that can severely hinder the QoL in children, there is a clear 
unmet need for a treatment that can prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss"
"As the first 
licensed therapeutic treatment for this disease, Pedmarqsi addresses this unmet need"
"
B.3.7"
"
Severity modifier 
In line with the NICE 2022 manual,62 the absolute and proportional QALY shortfall associated 
with established clinical management without Pedmarqsi (i.e"
"cisplatin without Pedmarqsi) 
was calculated"
"Within the updated framework, differential QALY weights may be applied if 
the absolute or proportional shortfalls estimated lie within specified cut-off ranges (Table 47)"

"estimator was used, which was cited by 
NICE as a potential option for calculating applicability of a severity modifier"
"This tool uses 
ONS data from England to generate the general population survival with various sources of 
data to inform utility estimates"
"The NICE DSU guidance indicates that directly collected EQ-
5D-3L using the Health Survey for England (HSE) 2014 dataset is a preferred method of 
capturing utility values, therefore the reference case data source in the Schneider et al"
"tool 
which uses directly collected EQ-5D-3L from the HSE 2014 dataset was used to represent the 
most recent and robust source for the base case QALY shortfall calculations"
"
The QALY shortfall was calculated assuming a mean age of 9 years and 39% female (as per 
the COG ACCL0431 baseline patient characteristics of xxx years old and xxxx% female, Table 
48)"
"The expected total QALYs for the general population were calculated using the Schneider

tumours treated with cisplatin without Pedmarqsi (i.e"
"the current SoC) was based on the 
modelled cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm of the Company base case"

As demonstrated, despite the rarity and severe burden of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity outlined 
above, Pedmarqsi does not currently qualify for the severity modifier"
"This is primarily due to 
the fact that ototoxicity does not have an impact on the survival of cisplatin-treated patients, 
and the calculations do not generate enough of a difference in the long-term survival rates of 
paediatric cisplatin-treated patients and the general population"
"The results of the QALY 
shortfall analysis may also be due to the conservative approach not to model the disutility of 
the emotional burden on parents and caregivers, thereby not capturing some of the disutilities 
associated with current practice"
"
As mentioned previously, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity has a severe burden on patients"
"
Hearing loss resulting from cisplatin chemotherapy can severely hinder the QoL for survivors 
of childhood cancer throughout their lifetime"
"Children are at increased risk of academic 
difficulty, social and emotional problems, and fatigue in the learning environment from even 
minimal hearing loss"
"Furthermore, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is very rare, with an 
estimated 222 patients in England and Wales expected to be treated in the first year (see 
Section B.1.3.1.3)"
"Given that this is a very rare and severe disease that can affect a child 
throughout their lifetime, the Company urge NICE to consider the severe impact cisplatin-
induced ototoxicity has on patients in England and Wales and the step change Pedmarqsi 
would present in the prevention of this disease"

Uncertainty 
The model base case has been based on Pedmarqsi trial data, NHS and PSSRU costs

Extensive sensitivity analyses have been performed to test the structural and parameter 
uncertainty with a summary of components and approaches tested provided in Table 50 (see

Managed access proposal 
The Company consider the Phase III RCTs COG ACCL0431 (assessing the efficacy of 
Pedmarqsi for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children) and SIOPEL 6 
(assessing the efficacy of Pedmarqsi in reducing ototoxicity in patients receiving cisplatin 
chemotherapy for standard-risk hepatoblastoma) to be suitable foundations for a decision 
regarding the routine commissioning of Pedmarqsi"
"In accordance with the trial protocols,17,75 
no further efficacy analyses are currently planned as cisplatin with Pedmarqsi demonstrated 
a statistically significant reduction in the proportional incidence of hearing loss compared to 
patients receiving cisplatin without Pedmarqsi (see section B.2"
for more details)

Both the COG ACCL0431 and 
SIOPEL 6 trials measured OS as a

Cancer-specific 
mortality 
Patients who 
have completed 
cisplatin 
treatment 
initially have an 
increased risk of 
mortality 
compared to the 
general 
population"
"
Published literature shows that 
children who survive from cancer 
are at higher risk of long-term 
mortality"
"However, there is no 
published literature which follows 
patients over their whole lifetime, 
and it may be unrealistic to apply 
this higher risk for the whole model 
lifetime horizon; it is likely that 
patients have a higher risk of 
mortality in the initial years 
following their cancer treatment"
"
Therefore, a cancer-specific SMR 
is applied for five years, the 
duration of which is based on the 
cure rates reported in TA53877 and 
TA81778"
"Beyond this, patients are 
assumed to have the same

However, in practice is it unlikely

The Company acknowledge that, as shown in Figure 12, the results from some iterations of 
the PSA lie in the North-West quadrant of the ICEP, suggesting negative incremental QALYs 
in accompaniment to the increased incremental costs"
"This is caused through varying two 
parameters in the PSA: the percentage of patients assigned to the Minimal/no HL health state 
in the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm, and the percentage of patients assigned to the Minimal/no 
HL health state in the cisplatin without Pedmarqsi arm of the model"
"By varying these 
parameters simultaneously, it causes an artifact whereby in some iterations, the cisplatin 
without Pedmarqsi arm becomes more efficacious than the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm"
"It 
should be noted that the statistical confidence intervals drive this impact – no SE or 95% 
confidence intervals are available for these parameters, therefore a standard error of 20% of 
the mean value is assumed, in line with other parameters in the model"

two parameters from the PSA, the cloud of results all lie in the North-East quadrant of the

"Subgroup analysis 
Due to the rarity of paediatric cisplatin-induced hearing loss and the limited patient numbers 
from clinical trials, no subgroup analyses were performed or considered relevant for the 
economic evaluation"
"The Company consider this appraisal should be based on the full 
anticipated licensed population"
"
B.3"
"Benefits not captured in the QALY calculation 
Due to the severe impact of hearing loss on patients’ QoL, especially in children undergoing 
chemotherapy for cancer, it is likely that the introduction of Pedmarqsi as the first preventative 
treatment for cisplatin-induced hearing loss, would result in substantial benefits outside of both 
the NICE reference case and the QALY calculation"
"
Given the impact that Pedmarqsi would have on education costs and employment 
opportunities for patients, it is important to consider scenarios outside the typical NICE 
reference case"
"Based on this, the Company has provided separate scenario analyses (Table 
56), which include costs from the Department for Education perspective, and from a societal 
perspective"
"Further to this, the Company has also provided a scenario which applied a 1.5% 
discount rate with results also available in Table 56"
"All these analyses improve the cost-
effectiveness of Pedmarqsi which indicates that the base case analysis is conservative, and if 
wider perspectives on the impact of hearing loss are adopted (which are particularly relevant 
in the cases of education and societal costs) this only further supports that Pedmarqsi is a 
cost-effective treatment option"
"
In addition, the introduction of Pedmarqsi will result in substantial benefits outside the QALY 
calculation"
"Pedmarqsi will reduce the need for parents and caregivers of children with cancer 
to choose between an appropriate chemotherapy regimen which includes cisplatin and risks 
irreversible hearing loss, or another chemotherapy regimen which may be less efficacious in 
treating the cancer but reduces the risk of ototoxic hearing loss"
"Further, the COG ACCL0431 
and SIOPEL 6 trials did not record data on the non-hearing effects of cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity such as dizziness and vertigo"
"As such, these factors, which are also likely to affect 
patients’ QoL, may be considered qualitatively outside the QALY calculation"
"Finally, the base 
case analysis does not include the disutility associated with the emotional burden on parents 
and caregivers, which is a further benefit outside the QALY calculation that has not been 
considered"
"
Given the above, the economic analysis presented in this submission is conservative as when 
wider perspectives are adopted, such as the inclusion of education costs, or societal costs, 
the cost-effectiveness improved, and the economic modelling also does not take in to account 
various other benefits of Pedmarqsi which are not captured in the QALY calculation"

"Expert validation of cost-effectiveness analysis 
Expert validation was sought for the cost-effectiveness analysis consisting of model input,

validate inputs for early economic modelling"
"Many of the inputs in the current cost-

throughout the submission"
"During the development of the current cost-effectiveness model 
for this submission, a protocol validation meeting was held in October 2023 with a leading UK

"Additional validation on the model was undertaken 
after its development during a meeting in January 2024 with a HEOR expert who is an 
Associate Professor of Health Economics and Health Policy at PenTAG (who are a NICE 
EAG) and a member of NICE's Interventional Procedures Advisory"
"This expert provided input 
and validation on the methdology applied in the economic model given the available data"

The economic analysis conducted as part of this appraisal is, to the Company’s knowledge, 
the first cost-effectiveness analysis in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity"
"This means that it is not 
possible to compare the outputs of this model with other economic analyses relevant to this 
appraisal"
"Additionally, because on average patients are on treatment for less than a year, the 
efficacy of Pedmarqsi is captured within the follow-up period of the clinical trials COG 
ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6, which allows trial data to be directly modelled without any 
requirement to extrapolate outcomes and subsequently introduce uncertainty"

"Interpretation and conclusions of economic evidence 
The cost-effectiveness analysis developed as part of this appraised is relevant to the 
prevention of hearing loss in paediatric patients aged 1 month to <18 years of age with 
localised, non-metastatic solid tumours having cisplatin chemotherapy in England and Wales"
"
Although there are a range of management options available for hearing loss once it has 
occurred, there are currently no licensed treatments for the prevention of cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity in paediatric patients in the UK"
"Even with the hearing loss management options 
available, cisplatin-induced hearing loss has a severe impact on patient and carer QoL that 
lasts a lifetime"
"Therefore, Pedmarqsi would provide a step change in the care of cisplatin-
treated paediatric patients in England and Wales, by being the first and only licensed 

 
 
preventative treatment for ototoxicity in this population, thereby fulfilling a large unmet need 
and improving outcomes and life chances for patients"
"
A de novo model was developed as part of this submission"
"The clinical data informing the 
model are primarily taken from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
COG ACCL0431 trial in which 131 newly diagnosed paediatric patients across the US and 
Canada were randomised to either the cisplatin with Pedmarqsi arm or to the cisplatin without 
Pedmarqsi arm"
"Baseline characteristics and dose inputs were also in line with COG 
ACCL0431"
"As shown in Section B.3.4.1, the patient population of COG ACCL0431 used in 
the economic model is generalisable to the paediatric patients in the UK which are commonly 
treated with cisplatin"
"The inputs and structure of the model has been validated by clinical and 
HEOR experts, as described in Section B.3.15.2"
"
The cost-effectiveness analysis confirms that Pedmarqsi is expected to generate 
transformative and substantial clinical and economic benefits to cisplatin-treated paediatric 
patients"
"In the base case, Pedmarqsi is expected to generate 1"
"additional QALYs at an 
incremental cost of £xxxxxxxxx, resulting in an ICER of £xxxxxxxxx, within NICE’s WTP 
threshold of £30,000"
"
In line with the guidance from the NICE manual (2022)62, uncertainty has been extensively 
explored"
"The robustness of base case results was assessed through probabilistic, 
deterministic, and scenario analyses with results demonstrating the stability of the base case 
with a high level of certainty: 
• 
PSA was performed to explore the joint parameter uncertainty"
"The probabilistic results 
are consistent with the deterministic results with a probabilistic QALY gain of 1"
"at 
an incremental cost of £xxxxxxxxx, resulting in a probabilistic ICER of £xxxxxxxxx"
"At 
the PAS price, Pedmarqsi has a xxxxx% chance of being cost-effective at a WTP 
threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained"
"
• 
Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through OWSA"
"The analysis showed that the 
cost-effectiveness results are most sensitive to the percentage of patients with 
Minimal/no hearing loss in both treatment arms of the model"
"Other parameters had a 
marginal impact on the ICER when varied between their upper and lower bounds, with 
results showing that Pedmarqsi (at PAS price) is a cost-effective use of NHS 
resources"
"
• 
A range of probabilistic scenario analyses were performed to evaluate key model 
assumptions and alternative choices of inputs to test the robustness of the base case 
results"
The model was most sensitive to the perspective applied in the model
"
The de novo cost-effectiveness analysis has a number of strengths: 
• 
The clinical inputs of the model are directly based on data from a well-conducted 
multicentre, open-label, Phase III randomised trial (COG ACCL0431) which showed 
statistically significant reductions in the incidence of hearing loss for patients receiving 
Pedmarqsi"
"
• 
The model has a relatively simple and transparent structure"
"
• 
A conservative approach has been taken for many aspects of the model for example 
Pedmarqsi treatment costs are applied to all patients entering the model as opposed 

 
 
to patient numbers after a mid-cycle correction is applied, disease progression beyond 
year 1 is not modelled, and carer disutilities are not included"
"
• 
The structure and inputs of the model are aligned with prior NICE evaluations where 
possible"
"Notably, Bond et al"
"which was the economic evaluation that TA566 
was based on, and HTE6 which is a NICE evaluation which also considered paediatric 
hearing loss patients (although not those cisplatin-induced ototoxicity)"
"
• 
Extensive sensitivity analyses have been conducted including multiple scenario 
analyses to assess the structural uncertainty of the model"
"Results show that 
Pedmarqsi (at PAS price) is regularly cost-effective at a WTP threshold of £30,000"
"
Despite the steps taken to develop a robust model, the cost-effectiveness analysis has some 
limitations: 
• 
There is a lack of long-term data for cisplatin-treated paediatric patients that 
experience hearing loss to inform long-term disease progression and mortality"
"As 
noted in Section B.3.3.1, a conservative approach has been taken whereby hearing 
loss deterioration has not been modelled in years 2+ of the model despite it being likely 
that a proportion of patients might experience a decline in hearing in line with that of 
the general population"
"Furthermore, COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6 demonstrated 
that Pedmarqsi has no impact on OS (Section  B.2.5.2) meaning that mortality is equal 
amongst the two treatment arms of the model, and the long-term mortality of cisplatin-
treated patient has been captured through inputs sourced from published literature and 
previous NICE submissions (Section B.3.4.5)"
"
• 
HRQoL was not measured in COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6, and there are no utility 
values available in the literature for paediatric cisplatin-treated patients by hearing loss 
severity"
"Despite this, the source of utility values used in this cost-effectiveness 
analysis are aligned to those used in the NICE evaluation HTE6, and Bond et al"
"
which is the economic evaluation that informed TA566"
"Additionally, a cancer disutility 
has been applied to ensure that utility values are representative of those undergoing 
cisplatin treatment"
"
The clinical studies and cost-effectiveness analysis outlined in this submission have 
established Pedmarqsi as the first preventative treatment for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity to 
demonstrate a substantial clinical and economic benefit for preventing hearing loss in 
paediatric patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy"
"By preventing permanent hearing 
loss due to cisplatin treatment, Pedmarqsi offers an improvement in QoL for patients in a 
setting where there is a substantial unmet need and therefore its introduction would represent 
a step change in the care of cisplatin-treated paediatric patients in England and Wales"
