Question,Answer
Does the Drug/Medical technology bring innovation?,"
Health condition and position of the technology in the 
treatment pathway 
B.1.3"
Is it an old HT applying for a new indication or a new HT?,"
In clinical practice, if only a small amount of a new vial is required, it is plausible that clinicians 
may not open the new vial after considering the cost and wastage associated with doing so"
Is this the second submission for this HT?,"This means that it is not 
possible to compare the outputs of this model with other economic analyses relevant to this 
appraisal"
"What is the type of HT (Drug, Medical Device, Other treatment)?","Many reported them 
to be extremely invasive, requiring a complete destruction of what remains of their 
natural hearing, leaving full reliability to the management device"
Was an appropriate comparator used?," 
Comparator(s) 
Cisplatin without Pedmarqsi"
In which country was the HTA carried out?,"Furthermore, the populations studied in both trials were highly 
relevant to the indication for Pedmarqsi and the scope for this HTA, as both trials were carried 
out in populations of children receiving cisplatin aged >1 month to <18 years"
What type of disease does the applied HT try to help?,"
Disease overview 
B.1.3.1"
Is the HT for a paediatric population?,"This population was 
the primary population for the analyses of the hearing loss endpoints"
What is the disease severity?,"
Determining what constitutes a significant change in hearing is essential to qualify the severity 
of the decline"
Are there clinical uncertainties in the literature/studies submitted?,These studies are summarised in Table 27
Does the HT try to treat an unmet need?,"Therefore, 
there is a severe unmet need for a preventative treatment option such as Pedmarqsi"
What year was the application and decision?,"
In the first year, the model structure is that of a cohort-based decision tree (Figure 8)"
"Was it in the time of a big crisis/change (e.g., COVID, BREXIT)?","However, it is noted 
that the scale was selected because at the time of the study, it was regarded as the most 
sensitive scale available to assess hearing loss"
Was the efficacy/effectiveness of the HT acceptable? Was it high or low?,"
This model structure was selected based on the following reasons: 
• 
It best captures the efficacy data that is available for Pedmarqsi; the primary outcome 
of COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6 was the proportion of patients with hearing loss 
after the end of study treatment, as defined by the ASHA criteria (COG ACCL0431) or 
the Brock grading scale (SIOPEL 6)"
"Was there a QALY benefit? High, medium, low?","
Table 47: QALY weightings for severity as per the NICE health technology evaluations 
manual 
QALY weight 
Proportional QALY shortfall 
Absolute QALY shortfall 
1 
Less than 0"
Did the HT submit a RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial)?,"
By removing the children who did not experience hearing loss (i.e"
Was the Quality of Evidence high?,"
Critical appraisal of the relevant clinical effectiveness 
evidence 
A complete quality assessment of the evidence informing the clinical effectiveness of 
Pedmarqsi is provided in Appendix G"
"Were there surrogate endpoints used, or hard ones?","
• 
Finally, there were also those who were using cochlear implants"
Was there an indirect or direct comparison to the alternative?,"
Indirect and mixed treatment comparisons 
As head-to-head comparison data from the SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 randomised 
clinical trials were available to inform the clinical efficacy of cisplatin with Pedmarqsi versus 
cisplatin without Pedmarqsi, no indirect or mixed treatment comparisons were undertaken"
How many patients did the submitted literature have?,"
By removing the children who did not experience hearing loss (i.e"
Did they perform a Meta-Analysis?,"
Meta-analysis 
A meta-analysis was not conducted, as the only relevant clinical trials identified were the 
SIOPEL 6 trial and the COG ACCL0431 trial"
How many RCTs did they submit?,"One patient stated that due 
to the hearing loss they were experiencing, they discontinued their chemotherapy to preserve 
what hearing they had left"
How many Observational studies did they submit?,"One patient stated that due 
to the hearing loss they were experiencing, they discontinued their chemotherapy to preserve 
what hearing they had left"
Was there a comparator in the submitted studies?," 
Comparator(s) 
Cisplatin without Pedmarqsi"
Was there an economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis?,"
Economic analysis 
No published economic evaluations of Pedmarqsi were identified in the cost-effectiveness 
SLR (see Section B.3"
What was the ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)?,"
 

 
 
Figure 16: Tornado plot showing OWSA results on the ICER 
  
Abbreviations: CI – cochlear implant; HL – hearing loss; ICER – incremental cost-effectiveness ratio"
What was the total intervention's expenditure estimate (Budget Impact) for the country?," 
Intervention(s) 
Pedmarqsi"
