Abaloparatide_for_treating_osteoporosis_after_menopause.pdf,"1. Yes

2. The technology will provide impetus towards a step-change in the management of osteoporosis as it will provide an additional option in the area of bone-forming treatments. I would hope that increased options will lead to slow but steady decreases in treatment costs, enabling a wider range of higher fracture risk patients to have access to such treatments. The latter is a major unmet need in the treatment of such patients."
Galcanezumab_for_preventing_migraine.pdf,"1. Yes: It is one of the CGRP monoclonal antibodies that are the first ever migraine specific preventive treatment for migraine (both episodic and chronic) which targets the underlying biology of migraine. It offers preventative treatment with a side effect profile is better, and a dosing regimen that is far more attractive than existing treatments which will improve compliance, drop-out rates and quality of life.

2. Galcaenzumab is one of the CGRP monoclonal antibodies that is first-ever migraine-specific preventive treatment for migraine (both episodic and chronic). The treatment after an initial consultation and training is self-administered through monthly subcutaneous injection that may only need an infrequent telephone or email consultation by a specialist headache nurse. This certainly will reduce the cost of care to the patient and the hospital/primary care. The side effect profile is better than existing treatment improving compliance, drop-out rates, and quality of life. Empowering patients, improving compliance, and better side effect profile."
Roxadustat_for_treating_symptomatic_anaemia_in_chronic_kidney_disease.pdf,"1. Yes. It is the first oral preparation to treat anaemia of CKD. It has been seen to be non-inferior to current treatment ESAs in the attainment of target haemoglobin and maintenance within the desired target range. Health-related benefits would be due to a potential increase in patient compliance both due to intentional non-compliance by the patient and inadvertent non-compliance due to having to rely on family members / healthcare professionals. There would also be a potential for a lower requirement of intravenous iron. Iron is an inflammatory substance with a potential association between labile iron and oxidative stress and has potential to cause well recognized hyper-sensitivity reactions necessitating it having to be administered in a hospital setting. An oral preparation would allow an increased number of patients to have treatment initiated sooner as there would be no need to book them into actual clinic to be taught how to use it. Patients could be counselled on the medication virtually or via the telephone. Due to not requiring cold-chain storage the tablets could be posted.

2. This is an innovate technology which has developed from the Nobel Prize winning work of the Oxford group under the auspices of Sir Peter Radcliffe. This technology will add to armory in the effective management of CKD patients and in particular those who do not respond to ESA therapy. Health related benefits data is limited at present and it is difficult to comment on this and if this therapy will be better than current therapies.

Yes – novel and the more physiological approach may have longer term benefits. The combination of increasing haemoglobin with endogenous erythropoietin production and improved iron metabolism is very attractive. Certain groups may particularly benefit from this therapy.

3. HIF PHIs offer a more physiological approach to managing anaemia of CKD and initial data supports a pleiotropic effect of drugs such as Roxadustat in terms of suppressing hepcidin, improving iron utilisation and reducing the need for iron supplementation. For the patient there is likely to be less need for attendance at hospital, less medicalisation of their home with no further need for home sc EPO administration. For hospitals it will mean less patients attending for IV iron infusions which means the healthcare resource can be redirected to deal with other tasks.

4. This is an innovative technology which has developed from the Nobel prize winning work of the Oxford group under the auspices of Sir Peter Radcliffe. This technology will add to the nephrologist armory in the effective management of CKD patients and in particular those who do not respond to ESA therapy. Health related benefits data is limited at present and it is difficult to comment on this and if this therapy will be better than current therapies; is all can say is that it is as effective and safety is comparable.

Yes – novel and the more physiological approach may have longer term benefits as yet not identified including its widespread pleotropic effects which may be positive as in lipids but also negative in other areas. The combination of increasing haemoglobin with endogenous erythropoietin production and improved iron metabolism is very attractive to simplify management."
"Nivolumab_with_platinum-_and_fluoropyrimidine-based_chemotherapy_for_untreated_HER2-negative_advanced_gastric,_gastro-oesophageal_junction_or_oesophageal_adenocarcinoma.pdf","1. Yes, this is the first study to demonstrate a benefit with immunotherapy in the first line setting for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Survival is prolonged by a substantial and clinically relevant amount of time. Additionally, long term survival (i.e. one and two year survival is also improved).

2. Yes. The treatment pathway will alter with respect to how long patients remain on 1st line therapy and in the ‘remission’ state due to the superior efficacy of this technology. Patients will, therefore, maintain a better HR QOL level for longer than with current treatments. This impact on health-related benefits and how it might improve the way that current need is met is substantial as the median survival for patients with CPS>=5 has improved survival beyond 12 months. This constitutes a watershed moment for this cancer and offers patients a survival outcome which is superior to a terminal prognosis."

Nivolumab_for_adjuvant_treatment_of_resected_oesophageal_or_gastro-oesophageal_junction_cancer.pdf,"1. The technology has a favorable therapeutic window as it has demonstrated good efficacy without significant toxicity or adverse impact on quality of life. Its impact on disease-free survival (doubling of median DFS) is clinically meaningful although overall survival outcomes are awaited. Immunotherapy has been a step-change in many cancer sites and is of emerging importance in gastro-oesophageal cancer. It is a low-toxicity regimen. There are not many interventions in oesophageal cancer that have shown a HR of 0.69 with high statistical significance and doubling of disease-free survival. However, the impact on overall survival is also required. Yes, improvement in survival is a patient group with particularly poor prognosis (median disease free survival 11 months).

3. Yes. These data clearly define a patient population who may benefit from this technology. Although the overall survival data from Checkpoint 577 is awaited; the DFS and distant metastasis-free survival curves look very encouraging with clear separation and an encouraging plateauing tail indicating the potential of long term survival at a level yet to be achieved in this patient population."
Atezolizumab_for_treating_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_after_chemotherapy.pdf,"1. The company considers that treatment with atezolizumab addresses a significant unmet need and represents a clinically significant innovative therapeutic option, which will provide significant positive impact on patients’ lives."
Aflibercept_for_treating_choroidal_neovascularisation.pdf,"1. Aflibercept is considered to be innovative because it is more potent than ranibizumab, potentially requiring fewer injections. This reduces the impact on patients in terms of the invasiveness of the procedure and the number of hospital visits.

2. Ranibizumab has been a significant improvement compared to PDT for myopic CNV, as the original comparator trials have shown. Whether aflibercept will be significantly better than ranibizumab is unlikely but it maybe better for some patients and would be appropriate to have as an option and both would be good to have as possibilities to switch to if the response is not as hoped. Not compared to ranibizumab but yes compared to pre –anti VEGF days of PDT or laser. No as long as ranibizumab is being offered. Maybe for a few who need many injections as this may lead to a more stable outcome, although most settle after a few injections but the condition can recur.

3. Aflibercept is innovative in that it is the only fusion protein licensed for use in retinal disease. Pre-clinical data have shown aflibercept binds VEGF many times more tightly than native receptors, and inhibits VEGF-A for twice as long as ranibizumab, but the clinical relevance of these data are uncertain. In contrast to ranibizumab, aflibercept also binds several other growth factors in addition to VEGF-A (namely, placental growth factor, VEGF-B and Galectin-1). These additional growth factors are believed to be involved in pathological neovascularisation, although their specific role and the clinical benefits of their inhibition in myopic CNV remain undefined. Current evidence does not suggest a significant efficacy benefit for aflibercept over ranibizumab in myopic CNV but it is very useful for patients and clinicians to have a choice of treatments, especially where these treatments differ in mode of action."
Elranatamab_for_treating_relapsed_and_refractory_multiple_myeloma_after_3_or_more_treatments.pdf,"1. New technology in myeloma targeting BCMA using a bispecific antibody. The results in a single arm Phase 2 study is very encouraging. Yes, new target (BCMA) and a new technology bispecific antibody with significant uplift in response rates."
Padeliporfin_for_untreated_localised_prostate_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes – it is an innovative approach to prostate cancer, and has shown a low side effect profile. It could improve the option for men with intermediate risk disease, or high volume low risk disease, offering them a cancer treatment with much fewer side effects than are seen in standard radical treatments. Yes – although it is one of a number of ways to deliver focal therapy to prostate cancer, it is particularly straightforward from a technical viewpoint meaning that the learning curve for delivering the treatment is very short, particularly for clinicians who have expertise in placing transperineal needles. In addition, access to focal therapy is not equitable across the UK with a minority of centers offering it, and many patients traveling long distances for it. Yes – to treat localized intermediate risk cancers with a low likelihood of significant reduction in urinary, sexual, and bowel function. Whilst other focal therapies seek to offer this, this technology is the only one to have been assessed in a randomized controlled trial. In addition, it has a short learning curve compared to the other two most commonly used focal therapies of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy.

2. Yes, for the reasons described above. Men, like all patients everywhere, want treatments that are less invasive and better tolerated."
Immunosuppressive_therapy_for_kidney_transplant_in_adults.pdf,NULL
Midostaurin_for_treating_advanced_systemic_mastocytosis.pdf,"1. Yes. This is the first licensed genetically-targeted therapeutic agent targeted against the principal driver mutation underlying SM. The SM population is particularly poorly-served by existing available medications. The population has very many unmet needs ranging across the different clinical manifestations of SM. The results of the phase 2 studies suggest superior clinical efficacy (in comparison to historical data from existing treatments such as cladribine and interferon) ranging across the different manifestations including symptom control and measures that reflect levels of abnormal mast cell infiltration (blood transfusion need, liver function, regaining lost weight, bone lesions etc.).

2. Yes – as discussed this is currently the only targeted drug with proven efficacy in patients with advanced SM. The 1-2 other treatments available are non-targeted and have significant side effects. Yes. At present the alternative cytoreductive agents are not disease modifying whereas midostaurin is. Yes – as discussed above in sections 9 & 10."

Axicabtagene_ciloleucel_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma_after_first-line_chemoimmunotherapy.pdf,"1. Yes. CAR T therapy is a revolutionary treatment which has produced impressive results in previously untreatable cancers. It represents a major innovation in cancer immunotherapy and in our ability to treat cancers without resorting to intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. It is currently commissioned in 3rd line treatment setting. YES. It is already currently commissioned in 3rd line treatment setting. Yes. For transplant ineligible patients it offers the chance of improved survival and potential cure without added toxicity of high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.

2. Yes. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

3. Yes. CAR T therapy is a revolutionary treatment which has produced impressive results in previously untreatable cancers. It represents a major innovation in cancer immunotherapy and in our ability to treat cancers without resorting to intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. It is currently commissioned in 3rd line treatment setting.
- YES. Intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant consolidation for patients with chemo-sensitive disease was established as standard of care for relapsed DLBCL in 1995 based on a small randomised study. With addition of rituximab to 1st line chemotherapy a high proportion of patients have chemorefractory disease at relapse. This is the 1st phase 3 randomised study since 1995 to show improved outcomes for relapsed/refractory DLBCL with a new treatment compared to current SOC.

Larotrectinib_for_treating_NTRK_fusion-positive_solid_tumours.pdf,"1. Yes. Enhances stratified approach to treatment. For tumor types in which stratified approach to therapy is not currently standard of care, yes. Less so for tumor types for which treatment (for some patients) is already based on CDx testing, although even in these conditions, NTRK-positive patients are currently treated with standard chemotherapy, so this is a step change in that sense.

2. Yes. There is a precedent for the use of genomically-targeted therapies in some rare and common cancers, however due to mutual exclusivity of “driver” mutations these therapies would not be available to patients with NTRK-positive tumors, so in that sense the technology would be a step change for this genomic subtype of cancer. Limited therapeutic options.

3. Larotrectinib is considered innovative. The technical team, company, and the NHS England and NHS Improvement National Clinical Lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund recognize the innovative potential, particularly since the adoption of larotrectinib depends on innovation and development in testing infrastructure. Despite the short follow-up and immature survival data from the trials, the company considers larotrectinib to be an innovation, likely due to its capabilities to extend life and meet the end-of-life criteria, suggesting a median progression-free survival increase compared to current treatments. Moreover, adjustments in genetic testing and treatment processing are expected to take a few years, indicating ongoing developments to enhance treatment efficacy and precision.

4. The response to the question about the technology's potential for significant health-related benefits and improvements over current needs is addressed in the first image, where the company highlights several points:

1. The company understands the histology-independent nature of larotrectinib and the rarity of NTRK gene fusion cancers present unique orthodoxy challenges to the traditional technology assessment process.
2. They believe that ""consideration of response by tumour location only serves as a distraction and introduces the potential for decision-making to be based on chance findings.""
3. The company disagrees with claims that decision-making based on tumour site effects is beneficial, asserting instead that larotrectinib has a ""large magnitude of effect irrespective of tumour site.""
4. Concerns regarding the BHM (Bayesian Hierarchical Model) methodology are mentioned, especially relating to the limited data and perceived inadequacies in the proposed statistical models.
5. It suggests that the response-based model requires surrogacy between response and survival, which the company argues is unsupported by evidence.

In summary, the company posits that the technological and methodological approach of larotrectinib challenges traditional assessment frameworks due to its broad and histology-independent efficacy, implying a significant potential to improve treatment paradigms across diverse tumour types irrespective of location.

5. The response to the question regarding the innovative potential of larotrectinib and its impact on health-related benefits as per the images can be summarized as follows:

Larotrectinib is claimed to represent a significant innovation in cancer treatment, potentially offering a paradigm shift in how cancer is managed by transitioning from tumor location to delivering treatment based on genetic identification (specifically NTRK fusions). This approach is seen as a step forward in precision medicine, capable of targeting specific biologically relevant markers across a broad range of tumor types, thereby providing an effective treatment option that can be less disruptive to patients' lives compared to traditional methods.

The company argues that larotrectinib's contribution to innovative treatment includes its ability to treat both adults and children within one indication, selectively inhibit specific kinases involved in tumor growth (TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC) without off-target effects, and its provision as an oral medication that avoids more invasive procedures affecting the patients' schooling and parenting roles.

Despite acknowledging these innovative aspects, the technical teams iteratively express concerns regarding the robustness and completeness of clinical data supporting the drug's effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, particularly for unmet needs, unrepresented tumor types, and broader end-of-life criteria. Consequently, while recognizing the potential innovation larotrectinib brings, concerns about data sufficiency and economic feasibility temper a fully supportive stance for widespread recommendation or funding approval without further evidential support."

Studies show the drug has potential to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This with the facts that the drug is used with oral administration and has relatively tolerable side effects present improvements to current practice. This is one example of targeted therapy and personalized medicine which is the current and future direction for cancer therapy. It is an additional potentially effective tool in management of recurrent disease.

2. Simple answer – yes. The improvement in survival seen with olaparib is clinically highly significant and important."
Daratumumab_with_lenalidomide_and_dexamethasone_for_untreated_multiple_myeloma_when_a_stem_cell_transplant_is_unsuitable.pdf,"1. Daratumumab is an innovative therapy which has become a key treatment in the myeloma pathway. It is available for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for HDT-SCT. We would like to see daratumumab with this mechanism of action available for all newly diagnosed myeloma patients.

2. Yes, this is the first in class monoclonal antibody to be licenced in multiple myeloma. Its use in first line treatment induces increased depth and durability of response reducing both morbidity and overall survival in what still remains a generally incurable but increasingly chronic disease.

3. This technology is a “game changer” in terms of advancing the disease control for patients with myeloma, limiting disease-related morbidity, and improving survivorship."

Pembrolizumab_for_adjuvant_treatment_of_completely_resected_stage_3_melanoma.pdf,"1. Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer and its incidence is related to age, however, unlike other cancers, there is a large increase in the younger working age groups (7-8 fold in the 15-24 year age group). There is a growing population of melanoma patients who are younger in age with the majority of their life ahead of them. Immunotherapies are innovative treatments that have revolutionized melanoma treatment over the last 5-10 years, initially in the metastatic setting and now in the adjuvant setting. Yes – but as mentioned - already being used via CDF. Risk of relapse from melanoma.

2. It is already standard of care. Further work is now needed to better identify who needs treatment and who does not. Yes. For years adjuvant studies had little impact on RFS. This technology has shown a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of recurrence. Patients value time without relapse, even if the overall outcome is the same. Time spent cancer free is associated with better quality of life.

3. Yes. The improvement in RFS for pembrolizumab in stage III disease is groundbreaking. Especially when compared to marginal benefits for approved agents in similar diseases (breast cancer etc.). The relapse rate for stage 3 melanoma is high and the morbidity and mortality associated with relapse is a significant burden. This is particularly so for the younger peak in melanoma incidence in the working age population. Prior to this technology development this population only had watchful waiting/surveillance. Currently patients with stage 3 disease are treated with surgical resection and surveillance. This population has a high risk of relapse with local, regional and distant metastatic disease. Relapse is associated with the need for further treatment (surgical, SACT) and significant impact of overall survival. Reducing relapse in this population is a key unmet need. Further to this, we have had access to this technology for two years now and built up clinical experience with safe and effective delivery to address the unmet need in the community."

Risdiplam_for_treating_spinal_muscular_atrophy.pdf,"1. This is the first oral medication for SMA that increases the translation of SMN2. It is an easily administered oral medication with little in the way of infrastructure costs for its introduction. Yes, there are no easily administered oral medications for SMA.

2. The use of an oral drug to modify gene splicing is highly innovative. The increase in production of SMN is increasingly recognized to be a key therapeutic target for SMA, and this drug clearly achieves this aim.

3. The use of an oral drug to modify gene splicing is highly innovative. Treatment with Risdiplam has shown to meet the primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trials for SMA I, II, and III. Risdiplam can address the unmet need of the population of SMA currently unable to obtain Nusinersen, or those in whom the administration of Nusinersen is particularly complex. The way of administration (daily oral administration at home instead of regular intrathecal administrations in hospital) may represent a much easier and more desirable way of use for patients and healthcare professionals.

4. Yes, for reasons already stated. Particular relevance in those who cannot access Nusinersen for both patient specific (complex spines, high risk GA) and MAA criteria (those with type 3a who have lost ambulation) or service related (lack of treatment capacity or interventional radiology support).

5. Yes, access to treatment for a condition otherwise managed by supportive care."

Pralsetinib_for_treating_RET_fusion-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. This is a novel, RET-specific targeted drug, and as such is innovative. Please see section 14 for comments of Quality of Life. Yes. No current RET-specific drugs are available. Early attempts at targeting RET used drugs which were no specific for RET, and so were troubled by reduced efficacy and significant toxicity. Both Pralsetinib and Selpercatinib are step-changes in the management of RET+ lung cancer. Targeting driver mutations in lung cancer (EGFR, ALK, ROS1) has been conclusively shown to be the optimal management strategy. Yes. There is no RET-specific drug available on the NHS for the treatment of RET+ lung cancer.

2. I agree with my BTOG expert colleague: “Yes, This is a novel, RET-specific targeted drug, and as such is innovative.”
I would suggest it and selpercatinib (the other RET inhibitor under NICE evaluation) are both step-changes in the management of the condition, and hence agree with my BTOG expert colleague that “Both Pralsetinib and Selpercatinib are step-changes in the management of RET+ lung cancer.”
However, only pralsetinib has a license for the treatment naive setting and hence, must be considered a unique “step change” in this setting.

Paclitaxel_as_albumin-bound_nanoparticles_with_gemcitabine_for_untreated_metastatic_pancreatic_cancer.pdf,"1. While the health-related benefits to patients should be captured in the QALY, the fact that nab-P/Gem offers a licensed treatment option with an innovative mechanism of action proven to improve life expectancy for patients with mPAC should be considered a ‘step-change’ in the management of this condition with extremely high unmet need. Furthermore, the more emotional aspects of an extension to life and the benefit of a life-extending medicine to the family and friends of a patient with a life-threatening malignancy should be considered, and these will not be captured in the QALY. These benefits were recognised by Pancreatic Cancer UK as part of their Two More Months campaign, launched in February 2014, in an attempt to ensure nab-P was available for use via the NHS across the UK. This campaign illustrates how access to nab-P could give mPAC patients and their families the ability to achieve particular personal ambitions at the end of their life. More broadly, preventing people from dying prematurely is one of the NHS Outcomes Framework measures for 2016–2017, and access to novel medicines for cancer provides wider societal reassurance that the NHS remains true to the promise of healthcare for all.

2. The Committee understood that nab-paclitaxel is a novel formulation of paclitaxel and that there was a high level of unmet need in this disease area. However, the Committee considered that all health-related benefits had been adequately captured by the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the model, and it agreed that nab-paclitaxel did not offer a step change in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer."

Further details or a direct response may be present in other sections of the document not visible in these images.

2. Yes - this is an innovative technology. It represents a new class of treatment available for patients with relapsed/refractory high grade B NHL and has the potential to induce durable remissions in a group of patients with no clear treatment options currently. This technology represents a paradigm shift in the management of R/R DLBCL, particularly post CAR-T cell relapses and in patients unsuitable for CAR-T treatment.

3. Yes. This treatment can induce durable Complete responses in a group of patients for which no standard of care options are available post CAR-T and also allows a highly effective treatment option for patients unsuitable for CAR-T or who do not want to travel to regional CAR-T centres. This represents a step-change.

4. Bispecific antibodies are innovative and allow the benefits of lymphoma response by T cell activation without the need for apheresis, manufacture, and long inpatient stays for patients. It also allows true “intention to treat” data whereby you would be able to see the patient in clinic and if eligible start treatment within a few days. This technology allow access irrespective of geography in the UK and also access for those patients who have rapid progression of lymphoma who are not stable enough to wait for CAR T manufacture. Step up dosing mitigates against CRS and is all done as an outpatient. At first full dose an overnight stay is required to monitor or treat for CRS (or a long day until day) but the patients' quality of life is otherwise good for this targeted treatment."

Ocrelizumab, which is a licensed anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is delivered by 6 monthly infusions. B cell repopulation after treatment with ofatumumab is more rapid than following treatment with ocrelizumab. This may be a significant advantage if there are further waves of Covid 19 or localised Covid outbreaks and for the efficacy of future vaccines. More flexible high efficacy treatment delivered in the home setting. There is an unmet need for people with MS to have access to a new effective treatment without a significant risk of PML or life-long autoimmune conditions.

2. The technology is innovative in its mode of delivery as a subcutaneous injection. Ocrelizumab which is a licensed anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is delivered by 6 monthly infusions. B cell repopulation after treatment with ofatumumab is reported to be more rapid than following treatment with ocrelizumab. The median time to B cells repletion to the lower limit of normal (LLN) with ofatumumab is predicted to be 40 weeks in comparison with a median repletion time of 72 weeks with ocrelizumab. This may be a significant advantage if there are further waves of Covid-19 or localised Covid-19 outbreaks and for the efficacy of future vaccines. The faster repletion of the B cell population may also allow more women of child-bearing age to access anti-CD20 therapy. Currently in the UK women with MS are advised to use contraception for 12 months after the last infusion with ocrelizumab. The current recommendation for ofatumumab is for the use of effective contraception for 6 months after treatment."
"Ivacaftor–tezacaftor–elexacaftor,_tezacaftor–ivacaftor_and_lumacaftor–ivacaftor_for_treating_cystic_fibrosis.pdf","1. Modulator therapy has brought huge improvements in the quality of life of carers and families, as well as patients, through positive mental health impacts as well as through the reductions in care burden brought about by poor patient condition. Elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor in particular, has changed CF from life-limiting, and for many untreated, to a manageable chronic condition. By creating such a revolution for patients, the same effect is extended to the lives of those who care for them. Futures that were previously impossible have opened up to 90% of the CF community and should prevent many families from burying their loved one prematurely.

2. These technologies are transformational treatments which, as detailed in other sections, confer huge benefits in terms of disease progression, quality of life and the potential to live a normal life expectancy while being able to experience more important life events such as raising a family. As detailed in other sections there are unknowns about how to ensure that the potential benefits are realized. Longer-term real-world research and assessment is needed in order to increase the possibility of realizing the full potential of these technologies.

3. Yes, the technology(ies) are innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. It might improve the way that current need is met by reducing in-patient admissions. CF care may therefore be met primarily as an out-patient service and via ""virtual wards"".

4. Yes. As discussed above, it might:
1. Improve life expectancy
2. Improve Quality of life
3. Decrease exacerbations
4. Decrease CF related complications
5. Improve sense of well-being
6. Reduce medication/ treatment burden and decrease need for healthcare contacts.

5. ""yes""

6. Kaftrio is innovative (in the same way that Ivacaftor was innovative for people with the G551D genotype). Kaftrio is a step change in management for those with Delta508 in the same way that Ivacaftor was a step change in the treatment of patients with Ivacaftor. We now have ~ 8 years experience of that that step change means in the short term (in the 2 year open label data for Ivacaftor use in patients with G551D and the HTA carried out at 2 years see Ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov) ) and in the longer term real world data by looking at the impact of Ivacaftor in the 2.5-5% of the CF population with G551D ( see Duckers J, Lesher B, Thorat T, Lucas E, McGarry LJ, Chandarana K, De Iorio F. Real-World Outcomes of Ivacaftor Treatment in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review. J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 6;10(7):1527. doi: 10.3390/jcm10071527. PMID: 33917386; PMCID: PMC8038673.). The real world data for Ivacaftor suggests that though there is the potential for a sustained step change that was NOT what we saw with Ivacaftor and understanding the loss of the “step-change” in adults on Ivacaftor is critical to making a measured Health Technology Assessment of Kaftrio. This is particularly important since the 2 year Ivacaftor data was highly favourable despite that data being collected in a period that was not impacted by viral lockdown which will impact the 2 year Kaftrio data see Hoo et al JCF (Hoo ZH, Lai LY, Sandler RD, Daniels TE, Dawson S, Hutchings M, Wildman MJ.

Yes , it is transformative in specifically correcting the

7. This is an innovative approach to CF care.

8. There is the potential for a notable and previously unencountered positive impact on patients’ overall well-being including their mental health. However, this may not necessarily be immediate as they will need to adjust to these changes (improvements) in their health and what this means for how they understand themselves (changes in; identity, illness roles, family dynamics, family and societal expectations etc).

With patients’ health being improved, stable and over a longer period of time, services will need to consider how they support patients in managing and reviewing their health, balancing their improved wellbeing with need for review and management (e.g. treatment burden), likely through a paradigm shift in inpatient and outpatient clinics and admissions.

9. This is the only therapies that address restoring the function of the defective CFTR protein – the underlying cause of this condition. All other previous therapies have addressed the secondary downstream effects of CFTR function – the organ damage.

10. Yes – only drugs of their type.

11. Highly-effective modulator therapy can be expected to have significant and substantial health-related benefits for people with CF with beneficial effects including improvements in lung function, reduced chest infections, improved nutrition as well as quality of life improvements. Highly-effective modulator therapy is currently available. This MTA is re-appraising the benefits of treatment."

Pembrolizumab_with_platinum-_and_fluoropyrimidine-based_chemotherapy_for_untreated_advanced_HER2-negative_gastric_or_gastro-oesophageal_junction_adenocarcinoma.pdf,"1. NICE considers how innovative a new treatment is when making its recommendations. If the company considers the new treatment to be innovative please explain how it represents a ‘step change’ in treatment and/or effectiveness compared with current treatments. Are there any QALY benefits that have not been captured in the economic model that also need to be considered (see section 3f)?

NICE’s TA857 recommends nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy, as an option for the treatment of people with HER2-negative advanced metastatic gastric or GOJ adenocarcinoma whose tumours express CPS≥5. Patients whose tumours express CPS<5 are treated with doublet chemotherapy regimens. This appraisal will address the ongoing unmet need and offer the first immunotherapy treatment option for patients with advanced metastatic HER2 negative gastric cancer and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in a broader patient group, thereby broadening the available treatment options for clinicians to use for these patients. Addressing a profound unmet need is positive news for patients which may not be reflected in the QALYs estimated by the economic analysis."
Abiraterone_for_treating_newly_diagnosed_high-risk_hormone-sensitive_metastatic_prostate_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. The technology has changed practice internationally. It is seen widely as a major advance in the treatment of this disease.

2. This technology will provide patients with a treatment shown to not only prolong life, but also lower the chance of relapse and reduce the chance of serious bone complications, with acceptable side effects and good quality of life. It will also allow patients and clinicians the ability to choose a treatment option that takes into account patient choice, comorbidities and resource as in the metastatic castrate resistant setting.

3. Yes – see above

Is the technology a ‘step-change’ in the management of the condition?
It mirrors a change already achieved with chemotherapy but with a completely different class of drug. Given that not all patients are willing or able to receive chemotherapy but nonetheless could receive abiraterone it represents a significant advance.

Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

2. The technology is a unique topical approach to managing CTCL patients which has been unavailable since 9/11, contributing to an increased use of alternatives such as radiotherapy and phototherapy both of which have significant resource implications and require prolonged courses of treatment and attendance at hospital often 2-3 times weekly for 3-4 months for phototherapy. It is more re-emergence of a treatment option that became unavailable following 9/11. Yes it addresses the lack of an effective topical therapy for early stage disease as most other topical therapies have only been reported in small cohort studies without inclusion of appropriate endpoints or have shown no significant benefits in comparative studies.

3. Yes, the technology is considered innovative as it is a new topical chemotherapy agent with no comparator, addressing an unmet need for particular patient populations, and represents a 'step-change' in the management of the condition."

• RCOphth guidance on Management of Ophthalmology Services during the COVID pandemic recommends treatment changes that can reduce the frequency of required attendances for the next few months e.g. changes in intravitreal treatment regime or longer-acting drug or procedure that would result in a lower number of hospital visits (RCOphth 2020, COVID-19 Clinical Guidance and National Information. RCOphth Management of Ophthalmology Services during the Covid pandemic dated 28th March 2020. https://www.rcophth.ac.uk/about/rcophth-covid-19-response/ on 3rd August 2020).
• During this unprecedented time of COVID-19, there is a stronger need for a therapy in phakic DMO with a predictable, extended treatment duration that would result in fewer hospital visits versus Anti-VEGF thus minimizing the risk of exposure to COVID for both the patients and healthcare worker.
• Diabetes is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality. A nationwide analysis in England demonstrated that a ⅓ of all in-hospital deaths with COVID-19 in England occurred in people with diabetes (Barron E et al. Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2020; 8:813-822).

Yes: the unmet need as described above.
The use of the technology addresses the unmet need for non-eligible patients and non-responders to current intravitreal injection treatments. It addresses a patients’ right to treatment. It is known that up to 50% patients do not respond optimally to anti-VEGF treatments. Clinical trials: RESTORE, VIVID and VISTA have shown that 50% eyes (pseudophakic or phakic) still have fluid, requiring other interventions. If patients are insufficiently responsive to anti-VEGF then dexamethasone implant will be recommended as per licence.

Imlifidase_for_desensitisation_treatment_before_kidney_transplant_in_people_with_chronic_kidney_disease.pdf,"1. Yes, the technology could provide a very significant benefit to selected patients. There remains a need to:
1. Identify the target population
2. Integrate use into the UK allocation policy
3. Standardise H&I practice
4. Protocolise the treatment of antibody recurrence and acute antibody mediated rejection

It could be if used effectively.

2. Yes. The technology is considered a 'step-change' in the management of the condition, potentially improving how current needs are met. It specifically addresses the unmet need of highly sensitised patients without a suitable living kidney donor, who face a much longer wait for a kidney transplant.

3. Yes, the technology is innovative and hopefully will make substantial impact. It would have been useful to conduct a randomised controlled trial comparing the technology with current approaches in light of new allocation scheme; hence it would be important to maintain a register of cases who may receive this drug and report outcome regularly. It will be a step change and open option for managing cases where current approaches has not worked. Yes, Tier 1 wait listed patients particularly who has not received offer despite one year of introduction of the scheme.

4. Yes – there has never been an intervention that allows for rapid cross match conversion / DSA removal in a timeframe compatible with deceased donor kidney transplantation. The clinical trials are innovative and offer a unique solution to the clinical problem. In that sense the trials are a step-change in clinical practice, not a reflection of it."

For everyone achieving pCR there would be an improvement in risk of relapse and death. Not currently and not until further data is available on longer term outcome and toxicity data related to the adjuvant treatment which of course may impact on outcome. With required longer term and toxicity data the addition of pembrolizumab may improve pCR rates and potentially longer-term outcome with longer-term EFS and mature OS data awaited.

2. Whilst there is early evidence of improved pCR and improved EFS in a single trial, an overall survival benefit has not yet been established. It would also be important for the trial to provide details of deaths from all causes, to exclude immunotherapy related sequelae contributing to this.

This is a highly innovative technology, in the context of current suboptimal treatments for this particularly difficult and debilitating complication of Crohn’s Disease, and has the potential to represent a step-change in its management.

2. Yes. This is the first approach to use technology specifically designed to heal Crohns fistulae. I am not sure about medium to long term outcomes as data is pretty sparse. Yes-a good proportion of patients end us with radical surgery which should be the last resort. If this can be avoided and patient’s QOL maintained that would go a long way to meeting a need.

2. Yes, in some instances. Yes

3. Yes – currently limited options
Yes

4. I would consider Siponimod with its application of use in patients with secondary progressive MS to be innovative and addresses a significant clinical unmet need. Siponimod treatment in SPMS has demonstrated a reduced risk of confirmed increase in disability and improved cognition outcome measures. Moreover, this is paralleled with improvements in surrogate outcome measures which include reduced brain atrophy and lesion volume on MRI.

This treatment therefore has the potential to make both direct and indirect positive benefits on health-related outcomes. The direct benefits include the reduction of disability and the associated socio-economic impact and resource utilization of a less disabled cohort of MS patients. The indirect benefits are such that the increased clinical vigilance of patients with secondary progressive MS even if not eligible will enable greater symptomatic and supported care for the condition."
Upadacitinib_for_treating_active_ankylosing_spondylitis.pdf,"1. Yes – improve pain, disease activity and quality of life for patients who have not responded to used therapies currently in use

2. This technology is innovative for 2 main reasons – it is a different mode of action to the currently available treatments. In addition, it's the 1st once daily oral agent available for treatment for axSpA with efficacy that's comparable to TNF blockers and anti IL17 therapy. This technology is a step change in the management of axSpA patients for the reasons outlined above. The biggest unmet need in axSpA currently with available therapies is adequate control of pain and achievement of remission. Patients with needle phobia would also be suitable for this treatment. In addition, for patients with interstitial lung disease, multiple sclerosis or family history of multiple sclerosis who are unable to have anti TNF would be suitable for this treatment. Finally, patients with active inflammatory bowel disease who would not be suitable for anti IL17 therapy, could be treated with this technology."

Using chemotherapy effectively at the best points of the patient pathways allows clinicians to sequence drugs that are most likely to help patients to feel better and potentially live longer with metastatic disease. This drug appears to be effective after other standard therapies, and the increased survival overall suggest that it allows patients to remain fit and still be sensitive to subsequent treatments. We have an increasing number of people who live with metastatic disease for many years. Careful sequencing to minimise side effects and main function/quality of life is very important as often people continue to work, be parents or carers. Agree- use of drugs appropriately according to the evidence helps the NHS to utilize available treatments to improve patient care. The mainstay of most people with metastatic breast cancer is chemotherapy at some point."
Tofacitinib_for_treating_active_psoriatic_arthritis_after_inadequate_response_to_DMARDs.pdf,"1. Yes. The mode of action is entirely distinct to any other licensed option for PsA. This is a significant step in our goal or personalised medicine. As we evolve the platform of drugs available, we will move closer to the model of right drug, right patient, first time. It is clear that PsA is a heterogeneous disease, and as the available treatment options grow, we will see the strengths of each agent become clear. For example, the skin / enthesitis / dactylitis responses vary across agents.

Although in recent years we have seen several non-TNF options arrive on the market, none have quite had the same success with treating the articular manifestations of PsA. The two NEJM trials of Tofacitinib have shown impressive articular response data.

2. Tofacitinib is a new class of agent directed at treating psoriatic arthritis and as such represents a beneficial and innovative treatment for patients who have been challenging to treat with currently available therapies. Yes - as this is a treatment that is a new class of agent. This is only the second post DMARD oral medication."
Patiromer_for_treating_hyperkalaemia.pdf,"1. This is a new area on management of patients with electrolyte disorders mainly as a consequence of medications and in part diet.

This will be an improvement from current therapies because these are probably less effective, have more side effects, and struggle to good clinical benefit in this aggressive sub-type of cancer affecting older patients.

2. Yes, this will be the first oral targeted therapy available for this population within NHS care. This is likely to lead to improvement in outcomes including quality of life and survival, and boost treatment rates. Yes, this abnormality is commonly found in older patients with lung cancer who may not tolerate or accept treatment with chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy in combination."
Xeomin_(botulinum_neurotoxin_type_A)_for_treating_chronic_sialorrhoea.pdf,"1. No

2. As Xeomin has been used pre-licence, it is not a ""step change"" in and of itself. However, as mentioned above, given the heterogeneity of care pathways, lack of guidance around treatment selection, and the lack of licenced medication until now, the appropriate positioning of Xeomin is likely to cause a significant improvement of sialorrhoea management. This addresses a significant unmet need in both patient care, and reduction of the mortality and morbidity associated with sialorrhoea from a health economic perspective. Hence, the appropriate use of this technology could be seen to be a step change in the management of sialorrhoea.

However, as Xeomin requires no cold chain, there is the opportunity for its use in the community. This does represent a step change, and is a significant difference from other preparations of clostridium botulinum toxin serotype A and B. This lack of cold chain permits ease of access to patients otherwise unable to attend clinic, and given the comparatively straightforward dosing regimen, represents an opportunity to improve patient care in a hitherto underused manner.

In addition, Xeomin is free from complexing proteins. Naturally occurring clostridium botulinum is found as a complex of the active neurotoxin and other, clinically inactive, proteins. These complexing proteins are not required for the biological function and clinical benefits of botulinum toxin. Other preparations of botulinum toxin do contain these complexing proteins in varying amounts, forming different complexes. The different proteins, including the active neurotoxin have different immunogenic potential as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The basic science of this immunological aspect of botulinum toxin is uncontroversial, and clinical practice reflects this awareness of the immune consequences of the use of botulinum toxin. To date, in over 2.5 million treatment episodes, no treatment naïve patient has been demonstrated to have secondary loss of response to Xeomin treatment due to the production of antibodies. This aspect of Xeomin as a technology does represent a genuine difference, and hence potential step change in the management of sialorrhoea by potentially preserving the efficacy of treatment long term.

3. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?"
Cabozantinib_with_nivolumab_for_untreated_advanced_renal_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. The technology being discussed shows significant advantages over current treatments available through the NHS, particularly highlighted with examples like the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab. This combination has shown marked improvements in survival rates and response to treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RCC, doubling the progression-free survival seen with the previous standard care. Additionally, this combination is noted for maintaining symptom control and quality of life better than other treatments, representing a significant advance in terms of patient wellbeing and clinical outcomes.

The safety profile of the combination treatment is comparable to the individual drugs taken alone, thus presenting a feasible option without additional safety concerns. Furthermore, although immune-related adverse events are a risk, these are manageable with proper intervention, ensuring patient safety.

Overall, these characteristics underline the innovative potential of the technology, not only improving survival but also the quality of life for patients, which is crucial in the context of severe illnesses like RCC. This aligns well with hopes for innovations in healthcare that substantially meet current medical needs while considering both efficacy and patient experience.

Sacituzumab_govitecan_for_treating_unresectable_triple-negative_advanced_breast_cancer_after_2_or_more_therapies.pdf,"1. Yes. This is the first antibody-drug conjugate to demonstrate significant efficacy in TNBC. The prolongation of disease control and overall survival will be invaluable for patients living with this aggressive and poor prognosis condition. The survival benefit is a step-change in the management of this condition. It provides an important and effective treatment for patients with advanced TNBC, who have a very poor prognosis with standard chemotherapy.

2. The psychological benefit of receiving a therapy that you know has a high chance of efficacy cannot be ignored. Yes, the response rate and overall survival benefit make this technology a step-change in the management of this condition. Patients with metastatic TNBC have an unmet need for effective therapies and a poorer median survival than other patients with advanced breast cancer, as outlined above. Patients with PDL-1 negative TNBC who cannot benefit from immunotherapy have a particular unmet need."
Ripretinib_for_treating_advanced_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumour_after_3_or_more_treatments.pdf,"1. Ripretinib is a novel switch-control kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit a wide range of KIT and PDGFRA mutations. It is considered innovative in the setting of relapsed metastatic GIST as it has the potential to improve a patient’s survival and quality of life. The current alternative is no treatment or best supportive care.

2. Quality of life (QoL) improvements would be compared to best supportive care as there are no alternative treatments for this patient population. The improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival are likely to translate into clinical benefit for this patient particularly as side effects from Ripretinib are largely manageable. Therefore I would expect health related benefits to improve with this technology. The INVICTUS study used the standard EORTC QoL measure and this remained stable in the trial in patients on active drug compared to a decrease in QoL measurements for those on placebo. Yes this is a meaningful treatment option for patients with metastatic GIST in the 4th line setting who currently have no other treatment options and which is in my opinion an unmet need. Yes this is a significant 'step change' the first in 5 years since the licensing of Regorafenib . The completion and reporting of the Invictus Phase III study represents a concerted effort by the GIST community worldwide for this rare disease.

3. The technology definitely qualifies as an unmet need in patients whose disease has progressed on 3rd line therapy. There is no standard of care after 3rd line regorafenib. It is innovative and is likely to help patients where no further treatments are available outside a clinical trial."

3. Yes. This is the first treatment to show a meaningful survival advantage of any kind in over a decade and it is the first time that non-cytotoxic treatment has been shown to help in mesothelioma. Yes – this is the biggest advance in mesothelioma in over a decade of research. Yes – as above, many patients will decline the offer of chemotherapy simply due to it being chemotherapy. The presence of this technology as a treatment option will be more acceptable to greater patients meaning more will benefit from prognosis and symptom enhancing treatment."
Pitolisant_hydrochloride_for_treating_excessive_daytime_sleepiness_caused_by_obstructive_sleep_apnoea.pdf,"1. Yes – no current treatment in this area so could have subsequential benefit (which needs to be offset with the substantial infrastructure improvement needed). Yes, it is a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses any particular unmet need of the patient population as noted above.

2. Yes. Currently no Rx for those failing CPAP.

3. Yes this is a novel drug with novel action. It is easy to take with few side effects and much improved compared with modafinil. It is not clear how many patients have rEDS as they perhaps aren’t investigated or looked for in the current OSA population. Therefore difficult to say if this is a step change. Yes as described. Those with health conditions that genuinely prevent them using CPAP effectively."

Idelalisib_for_treating_refractory_follicular_lymphoma.pdf,"1. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

2. Signalling inhibitors are not currently available in the NHS as a treatment option for patients with follicular lymphoma. Given that idelalisib is a first-in-class signalling inhibitor with significant activity in double-refractory FL and taking into account the paucity of alternative treatment options for such patients, the drug can be regarded as a genuine breakthrough in the treatment of this disease. Yes, it would be the first signalling inhibitor to be NICE approved for FL. Yes, idelalisib is suitable for older, less fit patients who would not tolerate further chemoimmunotherapy. This is pertinent given that the median age of patients with newly diagnosed FL is about 60."
Empagliflozin_for_treating_chronic_heart_failure_with_reduced_ejection_fraction.pdf,"1. Empagliflozin joins a number of other SGLT2i’s in demonstrating significant outcome benefits in patients with HFrEF. Therefore, while the EMPEROR-Reduced data may not be innovative, it maintains potential to provide significant health benefits in patients with HFrEF by adding to the therapy options and improving access to specialist HF therapies. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial data adds significant weight to the body of evidence demonstrating significant benefits of SGLT2i's in patients with HFrEF and the SGLT2i class represents a major addition to HF disease-modifying therapy. Empagliflozin improves morbidity, mortality and quality of life in patients with HFrEF thereby addressing the three core areas of unmet need already described."
Belzutifan_for_treating_tumours_associated_with_von_Hippel-Lindau_disease.pdf,"1. Yes, potentially. The technology undoubtedly targets the key pathway in a precise and effective way. Potentially it could decrease the burden of kidney surgery, and reduce damage to other organs (e.g., brain and eye).

2. Yes, the technology is clearly a step change. My understanding is that the response in the trial reads across well into the real world, with a response in many VHL related tumors and a decrease in the rate of needing surgical interventions."

Cannabidiol_with_clobazam_for_treating_seizures_associated_with_Dravet_syndrome.pdf,"1. Yes as judged by RCT evidence. No, it is another antiepileptic drug. Yes, as per Q8.

2. The company considers the drug to be innovative. However, clinical experts advise that it will be an addition to the currently available anti-epileptic drugs and is unlikely to represent a step change in treatment since no patient in any of the included trials achieved complete freedom from seizures. The technical team noted that the benefits of CBD in reducing non-convulsive are unlikely to be captured in the QALY calculations."

Human_alpha1-proteinase_inhibitor_for_treating_emphysema_(terminated_appraisal).pdf,"1. Respreeza is an innovative technology. It is the first in class and the only proven disease-modifying agent for A1PI deficiency, a rare genetic disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Until the development of Respreeza there was no effective licensed treatment option, and no treatment that addresses the underlying cause of the disease. Based on the provided budget impact and cost effectiveness analyses, treatment poses a low financial impact and leads to prolonged survival and retained quality of life in patients with a burdensome and life-limiting condition. It also increases the likelihood that eligible patients will be able to benefit from a lung transplant, by managing their condition until a donor can be found.

Treatment of A1PI deficiency may act as a catalyst for long-term benefits to the NHS based on increased research and innovation, especially the multi-systemic elements of the disease such as respiratory, hepatology, transplantation, genetics, dermatology, renal and paediatrics.

2. Absolutely.

I strongly recommend its availability for use in A1ATD specialist centres.

It is highly novel and will produce a change in the paradigm of care and clinical outcomes.

3. Yes, as delineated by my previous answers on clinical benefits. However it is not a panacea and further research into optimal patient selection, either through registries or biomarker studies in future clinical trials are still likely to be needed. Need would be met by (a) establishing of national centres (b) giving treatment to those most likely to benefit, such that their disease progression slows, disability and death are delayed.

4. The technology being referenced is considered innovative and has significant potential to impact health-related benefits for patients. It has been reported that patients, upon using the technology, have experienced improvements in their general physical and psychological well-being. The technology allows for greater exercise tolerance, less breathlessness, and reduced symptoms of fatigue, muscle and joint discomfort which overall improves the management of the disease. Additionally, it has the potential to mitigate the mental and financial impact of the disease on patients and their families, potentially increasing working hours and reducing the burden of caring. However, it's noted that while the technology ameliorates symptoms and improves quality of life, it does not change the natural history of the disease, which tends to progress inexorably without treatment. Thus, it represents a significant advancement in symptomatic management, rather than altering the underlying progression of the condition."

Pembrolizumab_for_adjuvant_treatment_of_renal_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Pembrolizumab is currently approved by several health authorities around the world for use in combination with axitinib as a first medication for patients with advanced RCC. Together with the survival data from the KEYNOTE-564 trial, these results suggest that quality-of-life does not substantially suffer if pembrolizumab is taken for up to a year after surgery as an adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence of the cancer. 

Patients with intermediate/high risk, locally advanced RCC are desperate for an adjuvant treatment that will prevent recurrence of their disease without affecting their quality of life. This will help to address the stress and anxiety felt by patients and their families and improve their psychosocial wellbeing after surgery for RCC. The benefits of pembrolizumab to patients are reduced recurrence of disease with a tolerable side effect profile and little effect on quality of life. This improves the psychosocial wellbeing of both the patient and their family members, allowing them to get on with their lives without the constant worry of the disease returning and a terminal prognosis.

2. Pembrolizumab is the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to be assessed as an adjuvant treatment for locally advanced RCC. Currently, adjuvant treatment to prevent the spread of intermediate/high risk RCC following surgery is an area of unmet need in the UK. An adjuvant treatment is desperately needed for these patients to improve their wellbeing and quality of life following surgery. Carers, family members and friends of kidney cancer patients would also benefit from less worry about recurrence of the disease following surgery.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK cancer survival rates trailed about 10 years behind other comparable European countries, including Italy and Austria. If the UK is to improve patient outcomes, including the patient experience as well as overall survival, it is vital that a tolerable and effective adjuvant treatment is made available to patients in order that they may have the best possible care. If adjuvant treatment is not accessible, it leaves UK patients at a major disadvantage in terms of the availability of innovative cancer treatments; these patients are likely to die prematurely compared to other kidney cancer patients in the rest of Europe and North America. Poor UK survival rates might possibly be due to the restrictions in clinical choice brought about by UK regulatory authorities leading to health inequalities between countries.

In the absence of biomarkers for the treatment of RCC, clinicians are not able to predict which patients will respond to which drug, and drug selection is accomplished by trial and error. Clinicians should have the ability to choose the most effective treatment pathway for individual patients, and without an adjuvant treatment, the clinician’s choice is seriously compromised. Some patients will face disease progression following surgery and will ultimately be diagnosed with a terminal condition. They will require treatment for metastatic RCC, along with the psychosocial support and increased cost of treatment that comes with a terminal diagnosis. An adjuvant treatment is paramount for the effective management of the progression of this disease and maintenance of quality of life."
Semaglutide_for_managing_overweight_and_obesity.pdf,"1. Yes. Most people will achieve double digit weight loss which appears to be required to reverse many of the complications of obesity. Yes, patients at high risk of the complications of obesity are not provided treatments which can reverse the existing complications.

2. Yes, this is substantially more effective than anything that has been available up to this time. There is a huge unmet need for treatments for obesity.

3. Yes. Most people will achieve >10% weight loss which appears to be required to reverse many of the complications of obesity. Semaglutide at 2.4mg weekly is by far the most effective treatment for Obesity at the current moment, causing approximately double the weight loss observed by Saxenda. It is therefore a step-change in the management of the condition as this weight loss is expected to improve quality of life, ameliorate obesity-related complications and avoid the need for bariatric surgery for some patients. It is also likely to facilitate other treatments these patients need for obesity-related complications e.g. in vitro fertilisation, joint replacement surgery.

4. Yes. Most people will achieve >10% weight loss which appears to be required to reverse many of the complications of obesity. Semaglutide 2.4mg once weekly represents a step-change in the management of people living with obesity due to its efficacy. At the moment there are no obesity medications to fill the gap between lifestyle interventions and bariatric surgery."
Rivaroxaban_for_preventing_atherothrombotic_events_in_people_with_coronary_or_peripheral_artery_disease.pdf,"1. Not with regard to CAD. Current evidence-based therapy is very effective. The incremental benefits seen do not justify the increased risk of complication, cost and complexity in delivering this technology. Additionally, the trial underpinning the evidence was stopped early due to efficacy benefits and the authors accept that in such situations the treatment effect may be overestimated.

There may, however, be a case to be made for benefits in patients with PAD. It may potentially address the increased risk of CV / limb events in patients with PAD.

2. This may have substantial benefit to patients on aspirin alone by reducing or preventing thromboembolic complications. Yes in a selected group of patients with the condition. Yes, patients on low dose aspirin alone with recurrent events and unable to take dual antiplatelet treatment. Rivaroxaban low dose may cause increase risk of bleeding in some patients especially those with moderate renal impairment.

3. Yes, this is the first anti-thrombotic therapy for secondary prevention that reduces cardiovascular and total mortality. The reduction in stroke was on top of high standards of secondary prevention and hypertension management (please see response to point 8). In my view, and this consistent with the view of international experts in the field, that the COMPASS regimen provides a step change in secondary prevention for higher vascular risk patients. The benefits were achieved on top of a high standard of guideline indicated secondary prevention."
Gilteritinib_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_acute_myeloid_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Yes. Gilteritinib is highly innovative as a FLT3-targeted small molecule inhibitor to treat 'FLT3-driven' relapsed / refractory AML. It will potentially remove the need, in many cases, to use non-targeted traditional salvage chemotherapy regimens to bridge the patient to allogeneic stem cell transplant. It competes however with Quizartinib which is seeking approval in broadly the same patient population. Gilteritinib (unlike Quizartinib) is also applicable to patients with FL T3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutations (as well as patients FL T3 ITD mutations). We understand that in the Admiral trial there were no significant differences in response rates and survival between patients with ITD and TKD mutations.

2. Yes. Gilteritinib is highly innovative as a FLT3-targeted small molecule inhibitor to treat ‘FLT3-driven’ relapsed / refractory AML.

A switch from relatively inefficient non-targeted intensive chemotherapy to an oral targeted treatment approach. The patient population don’t currently have a meaningful effective therapy – median survival is around 2-3 months. With Gilteritinib approximately 50% gain a meaningful response and in around 30% this is sufficient to enable a potentially-curative stem cell transplant to be delivered which will improve survival."

Blinatumomab_for_previously_treated_Philadelphia-chromosome-negative_acute_lymphoblastic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Blinatumomab has demonstrated meaningful and consistent efficacy in adult patients with R/R Ph- B-precursor ALL, in both TOWER and Study MT103-211 (including a comparison with a historical control), represents a major therapeutic innovation and a steep change in the management of patients with this devastating and highly aggressive disease that responds poorly to current salvage chemotherapy regimens and is associated with very poor survival.

Given that blinatumomab is indicated for a rare condition in a very small number of patients (86 per year) who have a huge unmet medical need and who stand to gain substantially from access to blinatumomab, this therapy meets many of the criteria for appraisal under the HST framework. Consequently, blinatumomab should be evaluated taking into account a wider range of criteria about the benefits and costs, as NICE does for HST appraisals. Applying the standard approach to evaluating medicines for this very small group of patients is likely to be unfairly biased against blinatumomab. Given the huge unmet need and the significant clinical benefit including additional benefit not captured by the QALY, blinatumomab is proposed for use in England and Wales for the full licensed population (i.e., in all adult patients with R/R Ph- B-precursor ALL)."

Upadacitinib_for_previously_treated_moderately_to_severely_active_Crohn’s_disease.pdf,"1. This is the first small molecule oral advanced therapy for Crohn's disease. The clinical trials results are definitely at the upper range in terms of clinical / endoscopic outcomes as compared to comparitors. It will provide a much needed therapy for patients refractory to current treatment who either face life changing surgery or ongoing active disease and significantly impaired QoL.

2. This is a first in class oral treatment option for patients with Crohn's disease therefore I would class this as having a significant impact on the management of patients with Crohn’s disease.

3. Yes. This is a different mechanism of action to available alternatives which is likely to be effective in a proportion of patients who do not respond to other therapies. It is indeed a step change and meets a significant unmet need."
Tafamidis_for_treating_transthyretin_amyloidosis_with_cardiomyopathy.pdf,"1. Yes, there are no currently available treatments for ATTR-CM, so Tafamidis would represent a breakthrough for patients and clinicians. Tafamidis has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular admissions in ATTR-CM. Reduced admissions lead to reduced workload for heart failure teams. Mortality, cardiovascular admissions, quality of life, and functional capacity are all addressed. Tafamidis is a well-tolerated once daily oral medication with no specific additional monitoring required.

2. Yes, it is innovative. If approved, it would be the first disease modifying treatment we could offer patients with wtATTR-CA that targets the underlying cause of their condition rather than merely treating its complications.

3. Yes – it is first in class drug that has transformed approach to ATTR amyloidosis and will have special utility in the black afro-caribbean population where there is higher incidence of ATTR amyloidosis (due to V122I mutation) and is often advanced due to delayed diagnosis.

4. At present, there are no licensed disease modifying therapies for ATTR-CM available in the UK. Data from RCT and real world observational cohorts consistently demonstrate improved survival, reduced hospitalisations and a slowing of disease progression in patients treated with tafamidis. In this respect, tafamidis represents a significant step-change for patients with ATTR-CM, offering a meaningful advancement in treating this condition. This implies that tafamidis is innovative in its potential to substantially impact health-related benefits and improve how current needs are met in the management of ATTR-CM.

5. This technology does represent a step change, since it would be the first potentially disease modifying treatment to become available for patients with ATTR-CM. However, the lack of measurable / biological markers of response in terms of effect on reducing ATTR amyloid formation is frustrating."

Nusinersen_for_treating_spinal_muscular_atrophy.pdf,"1. It cannot be stated strongly enough that Nusinersen represents a 'step change' in life expectancy and treatment for people living with SMA. There is currently no treatment and the drug uses an innovative antisense oligonucleotide technology to re-engineer a 'back-up gene' to increase production of SMN protein, vital for healthy motor neurone/muscle connections. For many patients (estimated around 1,300 in the UK), it could provide the hope of significant improvements in motor function and quality of life. For those with Type 1 SMA, (80% of whom would normally die before 2 years), Nusinersen should therefore also be considered as an end of life drug, providing dramatic improvements in life expectancy. In the ENDEAR clinical study, all babies achieved the primary endpoint of still being alive. SMA has proved a fruitful arena for new drug developments in recent years, with several other potential treatments showing promise in clinical trials. The most advanced of these is the AveXis gene therapy which has shown dramatic results in Type 1 babies in US trials and is now expanding its programme into Europe and other SMA types. The treatment involves complete gene replacement and trials so far have been based on a one-off dose. Nusinersen’s huge value is that it is currently the only treatment but the likelihood is that other, less-invasive drugs may well emerge in years to come. As such, it could be viewed as a vital 'bridging treatment'.

2. Yes: this is the first and currently only disease-modifying treatment available in SMA. The technology has been shown to be transformative in patients with SMA, improving lung and motor function and life expectancy beyond recognition. The results of the treatment trials were so clearcut that it was considered unethical to complete the work and they had to be discontinued prematurely.

3. Yes, nusinersen technology is both innovative and has huge potential. The current data on improvement in survival and motor function, in SMA1, is compelling. The technology is a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses a particular unmet need of the patient population where there is no other treatment available as of now which has anywhere similar benefit."
Trastuzumab_deruxtecan_for_treating_HER2-positive_unresectable_or_metastatic_breast_cancer_after_2_or_more_anti-HER2_therapies.pdf,"1. T-DXd is a highly innovative, targeted anticancer drug that is expected to have a significant and clinically meaningful impact on the management and outcome of patients with HER2-positive MBC and more than 2 prior lines of HER2-targeted therapy. The current experience with T-DXd suggests a substantial and clinically meaningful impact on health-related benefits. With a median PFS of 16.4 months (95% CI: 12.7, NE) and an objective response rate of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0), the outcomes with T-DXd are substantially better compared to any other trial in this setting, suggesting this constitutes a step-change in the management of patients with HER2-positive MBC and 2 or more prior anti-HER2 therapies. The current experience with T-DXd clearly indicates that the efficacy of T-DXd substantially exceeds those of currently available treatments in this difficult to treat population with increasing drug resistance and a high unmet clinical need. Given that patients on this treatment indication are often symptomatic and experience rapid disease progression, the high response rates with T-DXd together with the long PFS are of particular relevance in this patient population.

Importantly, efficacy in patients with brain metastases seemed to be similar to the overall population, which is particularly encouraging given the limited treatment options and high unmet need of this subgroup of patients (ORR: 58.3% (95% CI: 36.6, 77.9); median PFS: 18.1 months (95% CI: 6.7, 18.1))."

The use of atezo/bev will mean that patients with advanced HCC can be expected to live longer and enjoy a better quality of life whilst on treatment compared with current care. Yes, this is a 'step-change' in the management of advanced HCC, as demonstrated by the HRs for OS and PFS, and the improvements in ORR compared to current care. This technology addresses the current poor life expectancy in patients with advanced HCC, and will also improve their QoL whilst receiving systemic therapy.

3. Yes – this is the first immunotherapy and currently only immune checkpoint inhibitor based therapy to demonstrate a survival advantage (1-year survival improved from 54.6% to 67.2% and median survival not yet achieved compared to 13.2 months) with sorafenib. As demonstrated by the patient reported outcome measures it is expected to make a substantial impact on health related quality of life compared to current standards of care. Yes. The significant increment in efficacy extends to response and disease control rates with the potential to transform treatment for all those with incurable disease. Yes current treatments result in modest improvements in survival often at the expense of chronic side effects including asthenia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, plantar-palmar erythrodyseasthesia and rash. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab result in clear improvements in overall and progression free survival and improvements in patient reported outcomes (quality of life) and therefore fulfils the need for effective treatment."

Apremilast_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_plaque_psoriasis.pdf,"1. The committee heard differing views about whether apremilast was innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. It agreed that apremilast appeared to be innovative in its novel use of an existing mechanism of action, and agreed that it demonstrated innovation by providing an additional novel oral therapy. However, the Committee recalled that some people with psoriasis prefer less-frequent injectable treatments to more-frequent oral ones and therefore the Committee concluded that, in this respect, there were no additional gains in health-related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations.

2. Apremilast provides a novel use of an existing mechanism of action, and an oral alternative to injectable biological therapies. However, some people with psoriasis prefer less frequent injectable treatments to more frequent oral ones. Another advantage of apremilast over biological agents is that apremilast is not contraindicated in people with tuberculosis.

Avapritinib_for_treating_advanced_systemic_mastocytosis.pdf,"1. Yes

2. Avapritinib does seem to be a step-change in management of AdvSM in that it seems to provide deeper and more durable responses for the AdvSM such that the AHN often has a greater impact in determining prognosis. The depth of response to avapritinib (including CR and CRh) is also very important in optimising patients for consideration of HSCT where the major prognostic factor for outcome is minimisation of disease at time of transplant.

3. Yes – AdvSM is an unmet clinical need and my view (and that of other AdvSM expert clinicians I have spoken to) is that avapritinib is likely to represent a step change for the treatment of AdvSM.

The trial data for avapritinib indicates that it is a disease modifying agent, in terms of dramatically suppressing the underlying pathological process (the KIT D816V+ve malignant clone in AdvSM), reducing disease bulk (as measured by malignant mast cells present in the bone marrow and serum tryptase levels) and markedly extending patient overall survival.

My clinical experience mirrors the trial data. Patients I’ve treated with avapritinib have generally returned to near-normal daily life (in terms of activities of daily living, return to employment, caregiving activities) and once they have stabilised on therapy, generally need less frequent ad-hoc medical reviews than patients on other treatments. They remain on treatment several years after starting avapritinib despite having had serious manifestations of the disease at diagnosis (now largely resolved), with good quality of life.

By contrast, existing therapies for advSM (primarily midostaurin and cladribine) provide relatively modest improvements to clinical wellbeing and extension of life expectancy. AdvSM patients taking these therapies very rarely return to a normal or near-normal lifestyle, due to residual AdvSM symptoms, side effects of treatment (including GI toxicities and cytopenias), and the need for frequent hospital attendance to deal with troublesome symptoms."

Golimumab_for_treating_non-radiographic_axial_spondyloarthritis.pdf,"1. This is an effective and well-tolerated treatment. It provides a once in 4-week dosing which is not available from the current subcutaneous anti-TNF therapies. Golimumab is well tolerated and comparable to the existing anti-TNF agents.

2. Non Radiographic Spondyloarthropathy is a newer emerging concept. Currently, only a few therapeutic options are available for Non Radiographic Spondyloarthropathy. Inclusion of another therapeutic agent will have a significant and substantial impact on the patient group with this condition."
Filgotinib_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_rheumatoid_arthritis.pdf,"1. The key driver of RA is inflammation which can result quickly in bone erosion leading ultimately to joint destruction and potential disability. Filgotinib offers a new option in a relatively new class of innovative small molecule therapies (JAK inhibitors) that could potentially be positioned post DMARD failure or post first TNF failure. This represents a real step forward because it adds to the therapeutic options available to clinicians and patients. Also, it is an oral therapy which means that there are no costs associated with infusions or manufacture of pens for the sub-cut route. Due to storage requirements, the cost of refrigeration is not an issue as it is with injectables, nor maintaining the cold chain during transportation. Daily dosing is likely to fit easily into current medication regimes and the dose less likely to be forgotten than a weekly or fortnightly dose. Patients are very likely to prefer an oral (biologic) drug to have a regular infusion or having to inject themselves.

2. Yes, this technology is innovative, adds to the more recent class of small molecule targeted synthetic assets. This technology improves what is a relatively modest therapeutic choice in the form of small molecules. This technology has the potential to fill some of these unmet areas."

Nintedanib_for_treating_idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_when_forced_vital_capacity_is_above_80%_predicted.pdf,"1. Currently this cohort of patients does not have access to life prolonging therapy in the form of antifibrotics yet patients with an FVC below 80% do. Other patients with progressive fibrotic ILDs (other than IPF) also have access to nintedanib regardless of baseline FVC. It will therefore provide equality of access to an antifibrotic therapy for this group of patients with similar prognosis.

2. I consider this to be the case; the technology would be clearly a step change for many people with IPF; approximately 30 – 40% of incident and prevalent cases of IPF are people with FVC at or above 80% of predicted. Hitherto, they have not been able to receive treatment that could curtail the progression of their condition. Thus, the option for them to access this technology would represent a positive paradigmatic change. In this sense, the technology directly addresses a major current unmet need.

3. Yes, because current therapy is no treatment."

2. New JAK inhibitor directed at JAK1 inhibition (existing therapies target multiple JAK). New approach may allow successful treatment of patients that do not respond to current therapy. Greater targeting of JAK1 than existing therapies. Oral therapy, may be effective for currently resistant patients and good efficacy for the patient reported outcome of pain."
Entrectinib_for_treating_NTRK_fusion-positive_solid_tumours.pdf,"1. Yes. This is one of the first drugs to be applicable in a pan-disease setting where the presence of the genomic alteration drives potential benefit rather than disease type. The data available support the pan-disease benefit which is novel compared with other targeted therapies where the benefit is often limited to a single disease setting and where use of the drug in another disease type (even though the same molecular alteration may be present) doesn’t result in the same degree of benefit. There are currently no standard-of-care therapies available for TRK fusion positive disease therefore, the technology does represent a step-change in the management of patients with this genomic alteration and sets a precedent for the applicability of pan-disease treatment in the right genomically selected population and fits with NHS ambition for precision medicine based on genetic testing.

2. Yes, I consider entrectinib to be highly innovative with the potential to make a substantial impact on patient outcomes based on data showing durable and robust responses in NTRK fusion positive solid tumours. Entrectinib is one of the very first 'tumour agnostic' drugs with activity based on a specific genomic aberration rather than a tumour histology-specific subtype. Entrectinib does represent a 'step-change' in the management of NTRK fusion positive solid tumours, given that there have previously been no drugs available for management of this indication. As discussed above, entrectinib also represents a broader more fundamental step-change in our approach to precision medicine in cancer, being one of the very first 'tumour agnostic' drugs. Entrectinib has demonstrated equivalent anti-tumour activity for patients with CNS metastases, which are usually associated with worse prognosis and limited benefit from existing systemic anticancer therapies.

3. Entrectinib is innovative but its adoption is dependent on innovation around testing. The technology is likely to be considered innovative.

4. Entrectinib is potentially innovative in that it is a treatment for a newly identified rare gene fusion that occurs in a wide range of tumour types. The technical team recognizes that it is one of the first site-agnostic treatments to be approved by NICE. However, they are aware of other targeted inhibitors that can be used to treat a range of different tumour types and in those cases (for example treatments for the BRAF V600E mutation), larger studies have been done. Entrectinib could represent a step-change in the treatment of cancer. However, there is a lack of evidence of demonstrable and distinctive benefits of a substantial nature which may not have been adequately captured in the reference case QALY measure. The technical team considers that a major innovation is already being led by the NHS in developing more sophisticated strategies to improve genomic testing in clinical practice. These advance may facilitate uptake of treatments such as entrectinib if it is to be recommended. However, entrectinib is one of the first site-agnostic treatments to be appraised by NICE and represents a potential future service redesign based on biological marker rather than histology. The committee will consider the innovative nature of entrectinib when making its recommendations.

Committee will take into account the potential innovative nature of entrectinib as part of its decision making."
Latanoprost–netarsudil_for_previously_treated_primary_open-angle_glaucoma_or_ocular_hypertension.pdf,"1. Yes as discussed earlier; the proposed technology has demonstrated, in laboratory studies, the ability to reverse changes that may lead to increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage. This involves:

1) Reducing the contraction of the trabecular meshwork and the deposition of extracellular matrix, which contributes to elevated pressure.
2) Adjusting vascular smooth muscle to enhance retinal blood flow and reduce retinal ganglion cell death.

These mechanisms offer innovative ways to prevent the progression of glaucoma. However, studies using Rho kinase inhibitors have not reported data on glaucoma progression, such as visual field defects or neuroretinal rim thinning. The impact of this technology on increasing sight years and improving quality of life will be performed subsequently and would need to be determined through longer-term studies.

2. Yes as discussed earlier;

The impact of this technology on increasing sight years and improving quality of life would need to be determined through longer-term studies.

3. This is definitely a welcome innovation:
- Alternative mode of action – all other drops work in one of two ways, and finally we have something that works in a complementary way.
- This means that the drop has impressive efficacy even when the patient is already using multiple other drops. This is not the case currently, as after two drops, additional drops work in the same way without much additional effect measurable.
- Because of likely effects on the distal outflow system, this lowers the ""floor"" of the IOP, allowing good % lowering even with lower starting pressures. This makes it particularly effective for patients with normal-tension glaucoma (around 40-50% of POAG), or for patients that are particularly vulnerable to pressure and are progressive despite low pressures."
Ixekizumab_for_treating_active_psoriatic_arthritis_after_inadequate_response_to_DMARDs.pdf,"1. Another agent in the class already established but we know from experience with TNFi that many patients respond to one agent in the class but not another for reasons we do not fully understand and equally can have side effects to one agent within the class but not another. Not as significant a step change as a whole new class but still much needed. As above some patients fail to respond to all currently approved agents so they definitely represent an unmet need. Side effects unlikely to be any more apparent than current biologics. Patients are fully consented on the potential risks and data on adverse effects should be reported by the yellow card system and hopefully soon be collected on a registry.

2. Same mechanism of action as secukinumab so not innovative. Secukinumab is a human IgG1 mAb that neutralizes IL-17A. Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that neutralizes IL-17A. No, Latex free IL17A inhibitor product (compared to Cosentyx)."
Romosozumab_for_treating_severe_osteoporosis.pdf,"1. This technology will provide an alternative option for treating patients with severe osteoporosis. Currently only one other anabolic therapy for osteoporosis (teriparatide) is available in the UK, and is not suitable for all patients. The evidence for Romosozumab appears particularly strong in terms of a reduced risk of vertebral fractures; these fractures are known to be associated with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life and therefore a treatment that is effective in reducing these fractures should have a substantial clinical impact.

The dual effect of Romosozumab, by which it is able to simultaneously increase bone formation and reduce bone resorption (as evidenced by bone turnover marker measurements) does suggest a ‘step-change’ in management, as currently available anabolic therapies eventually cause an increase in bone resorption which may limit the gain in BMD achieved. However, to our knowledge there are currently no studies directly comparing these treatments in terms of fracture outcomes.

Teriparatide is not suitable for all patients, such as those with a history of prior radiotherapy to the skeleton, so this technology would offer a treatment option for these individuals. There is also a need for additional treatment options for patients at high risk of fracture who have previously received a course of teriparatide, and for patients who are unable to tolerate other treatments such as bisphosphonates."

This is likely to lead to improvement in outcomes including quality of life and survival, and boost treatment rates. This approach is a step change in the management of the condition, primarily due to its oral administration, making it a significant improvement over existing treatments that are more challenging to administer.

2. YES – IMPROVED SURVIVAL

3. Personalised therapy for poor outcome cancers should be supported. Yes, improvement in survival for this population has been modest (Valle 2010 and Lamarca 2019).

4. Yes, as demonstrated in The Claridhy trial patients have reported a benefit in QOL with improvement of their symptoms and social life. I believe the use of Ivosidenib in chemo refractory cholangiocarcinoma would make a significant impact on health-related benefits for these patients by improving their quality of life, extending their life expectancy (as discussed above). Cholangiocarcinoma patients lack effective therapeutic options. Ivosidenib fills this gap by confirming a remarkable value for a subpopulation of patients.

5. Ivosidenib will be potentially a second targeted therapy for cholangiocarcinoma, the first being pemigatinib for FGFR 2 fusion positive cholangiocarcinomas. Targeted therapies for this cancer of high unmet need unlikely her to have significant benefits with modest toxicities. As such it is a step change in the treatment of these malignancies."

Caplacizumab_with_plasma_exchange_and_immunosuppression_for_treating_acute_acquired_thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura.pdf,"1. Most definitely—as answered above

Definitely, a very positive change in the treatment pathway

Yes as per above answer re acute mortality, morbidity, exacerbations and refractory disease

2. The technology is innovative and complements current therapy. It is a stepchange due to the mechanism of action being a novel complement to existing therapy. We have seen the same benefits as the trial in the early access scheme. Certainly for those patients previously at risk of refractory disease and early exacerbations which are distressing for patients and families. We have seen less venous catheter infections due to the shorter duration of plasma exchange required. We have seen patients survive who historically would have been expected to die on ICU.

3. Caplacizumab may be an innovative technology. The technical team considered that there are potential benefits which have not been captured by the QALY calculation and there are also cost and wider benefits of adding caplacizumab to standard care which may not have been fully accounted for in the model.

4. Caplacizumab is likely to be innovative. It shows a step change in treatment by decreasing the time to recovery and reducing hospital stays and plasma exchange therapy. Potential benefits not captured in QALY are limiting time patients need plasma exchange and immunosuppression and the impact this has on their quality of life, and the impact on patient anxiety of having an effective treatment. Although the effect of caplacizumab on mortality, neuropsychological impairment, and cognitive impairment is unclear, the company model considers the potential for caplacizumab to have a benefit on these outcomes. In the absence of data to robustly show that caplacizumab improves survival compared with standard care in the short term (when a person has their initial treatment in hospital), this aspect is less certain.

5. The ERG agrees with the company that there are further potential benefits from this technology, including reduced ICU stay, reduced plasma requirements, and reduced exposure to micro-thrombi as stated in Issue 11. However, these benefits have not been quantified and thus are not captured in the model. ERG CRITIQUE OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE"

"Pembrolizumab_plus_chemotherapy_for_untreated,_triple-negative,_locally_recurrent_unresectable_or_metastatic_breast_cancer.pdf","1. The technology offers flexibility for clinicians to select a backbone taxane regimen to be administered alongside pembrolizumab based on clinical trial data from Keynote-355. A high unmet medical still remains for patients with locally advanced or inoperable TNBC and therefore patients would benefit from having an additional innovative treatment option becoming available. In particular, KEYNOTE-355 potentially included more severe population based on study inclusion with regards to DFI for study inclusion. Further, patients still experience a poor prognosis with an overall survival ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 life years with the current SoC and introduction of pembrolizumab + taxanes is anticipated to improve this further.

In the base-case analysis versus paclitaxel, the estimated mean OS with pembrolizumab in combination with taxanes was 3.795 life years versus 1.808 for the taxane chemotherapy comparators, resulting in a net QALY gain of [blank] QALYs versus [blank] among patients treated with taxanes. Therefore, pembrolizumab in combination with taxanes provides an incremental LY gain of 1.987 and an incremental QALY gain of [blank] versus standard taxane chemotherapies. MSD considers pembrolizumab in combination with taxanes to offer an unprecedented increase in life years and QALYs for a population experiencing very poor survival outcomes with the current standards of care.

Pembrolizumab in combination with taxanes for the treatment of locally advanced inoperable TNBC is highly cost-effective versus the paclitaxel chemotherapy with PSA ICER £29,423/QALY and a WTP of 79.6% using PAS price, at £50,000/QALY WTP Threshold. Whilst noting the limitations and uncertainty for the comparisons versus atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel, pembrolizumab in combination with taxanes has the potential to be cost-effective across a number of plausible scenarios once confidential discounts for comparators have been included.

In conclusion, the de novo economic analysis brings together the best available clinical data to establish the comparative efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in the PD-L1 positive CPS ≥ 10 score patients with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic TNBC."
"Niraparib_for_maintenance_treatment_of_advanced_ovarian,_fallopian_tube_and_peritoneal_cancer_after_response_to_first-line_platinum-based_chemotherapy.pdf","1. Yes. The majority (80%) of patients with ovarian/fallopian tube/ primary peritoneal cancer have poor outcomes as they present with advanced incurable disease ovarian cancer. Maintenance PARP inhibitor therapy has the potential to significantly impact the progression free survival of these patients and for some may offer a potential cure. Although the data currently immature for niraparib, current evidence indicates the effects of PARP inhibitors are a class effect in the frontline (SOLO1/ PRIMA/PAOLA/ AbbVie) and relapsed setting (NOVA/SOLO2/Ariel 3) and so the data seen with olaparib in the SOLO1 trial recently presented at ESMO are likely to be indicative for niraparib in the frontline setting, taking into account some of the different eligibility criteria (Olaparib- BRCA mutant patients only- indicates that after 5 years, 48.3% of patients treated with olaparib had not experienced disease progression and were still living with stable disease vs 20.5% of those taking placebo. Progression free survival was 56 months (olaparib), compared with 13.8 for individuals who received standard treatment only.)

It is clear that PARP inhibitors are a significantly step forward in the treatment of this disease, with the potential for long term survival that has not been seen with any other therapy to date. Furthermore the benefits of these oral treatments extend beyond the time that patients are taking the therapy reducing the burden on patients and potentially healthcare costs –in the relapsed setting patients remain on medication until progression rather than a defined period in the front line setting. Preventing relapse is an essential outcome, as once relapsed generally this patient group are considered incurable."
Fedratinib_for_treating_disease-related_splenomegaly_or_symptoms_in_myelofibrosis.pdf,"1.

Faricimab_for_treating_diabetic_macular_oedema.pdf,"1. Yes. Further investigation will be needed to provide recommendations on the appropriate intervals between treatment. For example, Aflibercept and Ranibizumab are both recommended to be more effective on a Treat and Extend regime rather than PRN. Stopping rules should be considered as part of the technology appraisal, although may be better considered by a clinical guideline. However, the impact is likely to be on the service provision organisation rather than a novel way of treating people with DMO.

2. The innovative nature of this technology in terms of using Ang-2 blockade in partnership with the well established anti VEGF effect in DMO has the potential to have a significant and substantial impact on patients in terms of reduced injection intervals. This will have benefits for patients and healthcare providers freeing up resources and time to see the growing number of DMO patients.

3. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

4. Yes. Its dual mode of action via the anti-VEGF and Ang-2 pathways makes the technology innovative. The reduction in number of treatments should impact on current unmet needs. The potential reduction in number of treatments should impact on current unmet needs."

The reduction in relapse risk for patients is significant (see previous comments) -given downstream implications of relapse.

2. Using antibody drug conjugates is innovative in DLBCL. The PFS is of clinical benefit and it is important to try and prevent a relapse event. No OS benefit was seen, this maybe because we have many other lines of therapy for patients but these come at high cost to patient and NHS."
Ravulizumab_for_treating_paroxysmal_nocturnal_haemoglobinuria.pdf,"1. Surveyed patients treated with ravulizumab have experience of receiving ravulizumab since 2017 until the present (both during the trial and after the trial completed) and therefore their experiences of the therapy extend beyond the trial period. Ravulizumab is innovative is the frequency of its delivery (i.e. 8 weekly) which represents significant increased independence from a fortnightly infusion and the negative consequences of that (on employment, family and social life and psychological impact) and an improvement in quality of life for both patients and their families. Reduced treatment frequency also requires less oversight by the overburdened NHS. Less contact between patients and medical personnel also reduced the risk of infection with COVID 19 to patients already vulnerable to infection.

Patients currently receiving ravulizumab and their carers were also surveyed about the impact to them of having to revert to treatment with eculizumab, should ravulizumab not be approved for treatment. Of the 16 responses by patients, the burden of fortnightly infusions including the negative affect of cannulation every 2 weeks and concern about deterioration in their current symptom control were the most significant impacts. These were followed by the negative effect on their quality of life generally including family life their employment (and the ability to be able to work/work full time). The negative psychological impact was also identified: ""My overall mental health & wellbeing would greatly suffer and I would be afraid of going back into depression"" and the loss of recently found independence. ""I am sure that there would be a deterioration in my mental health as my life would be dominated by treatment again"". ""I have tasted freedom and normality for 3 years and going back to treatment with the two weekly Eculizumab, will take that away from me."" Of the 6 responses by carers of patients currently receiving ravulizumab, many referred to the burden of the fortnightly infusions: ""would marry your life becomes a 2 week cycle and everything has to be planned around that"" and the impact on employment would also be negative: ""they would have their independence lessened considerably and would struggle to lead a normal and economically productive life."" They also identified the negative impact on quality of life generally including family life and the loss of a ""normal life"". ""A normal life would go [sic] gone - the general well being of the family would be affected"" together with negative psychological impact: ""A grave impact

2. Ravulizumab is innovative as it increases independence for PNH patients and their families by reducing treatment frequency to every 8 weeks, enhancing quality of life and minimizing negative impacts on employment, family, and social life. The extended duration between treatments also mitigates the psychological stress associated with frequent hospital visits, and roughly 80% of patients expressed a preference for this treatment over others when surveyed. This has led to a possible perception of a ""normal life"" with significantly reduced interruptions.

3. The current clinical need is met with eculizumab by improving both the survival and QoL, but Ravulizumab will sustain this improvement in survival, but will also improve QOL (due to less frequent infusions) and also less chance of BTH, and a sustained control of dysregulated complement compared to eculizumab."
Acalabrutinib_for_treating_chronic_lymphocytic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Yes, use of acalabrutinib would result in a higher QALY compared to CIT (significantly reduced risk of infections and anticipated reduction in secondary cancer, no need to attend day wards for infusions) and Ibrutinib (reduced incidence of cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation (reported in up to 10% of individuals) and hypertension (reported in up to 50% of individuals)). Frontline: Cessation of chemo-immunotherapy in the frontline setting, which would be the consequence of introduction in the frontline setting, would be step change. Relapse: The technology is similar to current practice. Yes, frontline patients for whom CIT is not suitable.

2. The response to the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?' is:

• Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
• Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

3. Yes: fewer hospital admissions and ITU admissions; fewer trips to hospital during the COVID pandemic (tablets can be posted to patients, therefore less infection risk and patients can continue to shield). Longer remission duration always translates into improved quality of life, but is never measured in clinical studies as patients come off study when they relapse. Lower rate of grade 1-2 infections has a big impact on quality of life, but is also rarely measured."
"Olaparib_with_bevacizumab_for_maintenance_treatment_of_advanced_high-grade_epithelial_ovarian,_fallopian_tube_or_primary_peritoneal_cancer.pdf","1.

This with the facts that the drug is used with oral administration and has relatively tolerable side effects present improvements to current practice. Yes, this is one example of targeted therapy and personalized medicine which is the current and future direction for cancer therapy.

2. Yes. There is very significant improvement in PFS in HRD population (including those that do not have BRCA1/2 mutation) plus significant improvement in OS in this population. Improving OS in ovarian cancer is very, very challenging, so this represents a step-change. Importantly, there is evidence of absence of benefit in the non-HRD population, thus preventing patients from being treated with toxic therapy that is of no benefit. These patients remain a population of unmet need, but this lies outside the scope of this TA."
Secukinumab_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_hidradenitis_suppurativa.pdf,"1. Yes, the first anti-IL17 for HS and provides a much-needed alternative to adalimumab.

Linzagolix_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_symptoms_of_uterine_fibroids.pdf,"1. Yes, the technology is innovative as it meets the unmet needs of women with fibroids in terms of provision of a long-term use medication that addresses the issues of side effects when compared to GnRH analogues and also addresses the issues of side effects mainly the potential for menopausal symptoms including effects on bone. In addition, there is a titratable dosage regimen that addresses the issue of side effects and the ability to administer the medication in different clinical scenarios depending on the needs of the patient.

2. Yes: First ever migraine specific preventive drug. Little or no side effects. Self-Administered.

3. Yes. Provides a considerable advantage in the way in which migraine is prevented. It is likely to reduce transformation of episodic to chronic migraine and the additional burden of medication overuse headache. A significant step change and most important innovation since introduction of Triptans for acute migraine management.

Trastuzumab_deruxtecan_for_treating_HER2-low_metastatic_or_unresectable_breast_cancer_after_chemotherapy.pdf,"1. The response to the highlighted question about the technology’s innovation and potential health-related impact is addressed in the documents. In the excerpt from pages 158 and 159, the technology, T-DXd, is recognized for its innovative approach in extending life by over 3 months compared to current standard care for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer with a short life expectancy (<24 months). This increase in survival strongly supports its standing as offering a substantial additional health benefit. The innovation also aligns with previous NICE EOL criteria since it prolongs life expectancy meaningfully within the given timeframe for end-of-life treatments. Furthermore, the calculated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) shortfall analysis suggests that the technology satisfies NICE's criteria for added weight in decision-making, reflecting a significant impact against the backdrop of current medical options and severe disease impact. This reinforces the technology's potential to improve the existing treatment landscape substantially.

2. This is a completely new and additional form of treatment for a significant proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients. Metastatic breast cancer still has a poor overall prognosis and so anything that can improve survival in these patients is an advantage for them."
Daratumumab_in_combination_for_treating_newly_diagnosed_systemic_amyloid_light-chain_amyloidosis.pdf,"1. Further studies have shown that using daratumumab in AL Amyloidosis is a highly effective agent that produced rapid and deep hematologic responses without increasing toxicity. Daratumumab is an innovative technology which we consider has potential to make a significant and substantial impact.

2. The treatment itself has the potential to improve life expectancy and quality of life as Daratumumab appears to be more efficacious in the clinical trial setting than standard of care. The process of licensing an up front treatment for AL amyloidosis will also impact on access to treatment in its own right, potentially changing the landscape of treatment for these patients. Yes, as AL amyloidosis has not previously had its own licensed treatment this would be a step change in the management of the condition. The may be better adherence to treatment as Daratumumab has been well tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis, some patients with significant neuropathy may not be able to have Bortezomib and if licensed in combination with different agents it would enable more flexibility for patients who are difficult to treat due to Amyloid disease side effects.

3. Yes. Currently, AL amyloidosis is seen by many clinicians as a fatal condition which is futile to treat. With this technology and improved responses, there is potential for clinicians to diagnose earlier and improve patient survival and quality of life. Yes. By addressing the early mortality still seen despite treatment by improving the early response.

4. The results of ANDROMEDA highlight the potential for daratumumab to deliver significant improvements to haematological and organ response rates than found with current treatment options. Availability of a treatment would also likely have the secondary impact of increasing awareness of AL amyloidosis, thereby potentially driving earlier diagnosis and expediting treatment.

Clearly so – particularly given the lack of availability of treatments approved for use in AL amyloidosis and the poor prognosis and low quality of life that these patients currently suffer.

Clear unmet need, as there is currently no licensed treatment for AL amyloidosis.

5. There is no response provided in the images for the question regarding the technology's innovation and its potential significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. The response sections for question 18 are blank."
Mavacamten_for_treating_symptomatic_obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy.pdf,"1. Mavacamten may offer a therapeutic option to severely symptomatic patients not eligible for invasive gradient reduction therapy (by surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation) either through comorbidities or unsuitable anatomy or those who express a preference for a non-invasive approach. It would also provide an option for the reasonable number of patients who experience limiting side effects with existing pharmacotherapy or who experience an incomplete symptomatic response to existing treatment. However, there really need to be trials of mavacamten in addition to dual therapy with a beta-blocker/calcium channel antagonist and disopyramide with a substantial number of patients on the latter. If mavacamten is to supplant the latter due to perhaps better tolerability and/or efficacy, there need to be head-to-head comparative trials to substantiate this.

It is a first-in-class therapy specifically designed to address LVOT obstruction in HCM as opposed to repurposing of existing drugs. In EXPLORER-HCM, the number needed to treat to achieve a large or very large change in KCCQ-CS score was ~5,6,7 however, whether a similar magnitude of benefit would have been seen among responders had they been on disopyramide (a more cogent comparator) is unclear.

It potentially offers a genuinely new therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for invasive therapy or who cannot tolerate existing medical therapy or achieve satisfactory quality of life with the latter due to side effects or incomplete efficacy.

2. Yes. Mavacamten offers a disease specific treatment for symptomatic LVOTO. In the trials, it demonstrated significant quantitative and qualitative benefits. It may decrease the need for invasive septal reduction techniques, which have long waiting lists, as a result of the expertise required and a limited number of centres performing these niche procedures.

3. Yes. It may provide a non-invasive method of ameliorating left ventricular outflow obstruction in patients who are refractory to current medical therapies such as beta blockers, calcium channel antagonists and disopyramide. Currently, the pharmacological treatment available for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inadequate and some drugs are poorly tolerated by patients hence their condition is not managed appropriately. Up to 10% of patients with HCM have dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction that is not easily treated with pharmacological agents.

4. Yes, this is the first disease-specific drug developed for HCM, targeting the underlying pathophysiology. Based on the results of the clinical trials, the drug is well tolerated and likely to result in a significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life, as well as a likely reduction in the need for invasive therapies.

5. The images provided do not contain a response to the question cited. They display only the question itself and sections of other unrelated information.

6. The technology is disruptive to the service; implementation of the technology adds burden to patients, healthcare providers, and clinicians. However, it is expected that the patients are seen in specialist centers, where added patient monitoring is unlikely to cause significant additional burden. Furthermore, it is likely that this technology would be recommended for routine commissioning disregarding the cost of the technology."

2. The response to the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?' is:

Reduced cardiac monitoring and admissions for initiation. Better blood safety profiles compared to existing SIP inhibitor. No, valuable additional therapy that bridges the gap between first and second line therapies, easier to use with reduced admissions and better safety profile."
Nivolumab_with_ipilimumab_and_chemotherapy_for_untreated_metastatic_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. No. Not in my opinion. It provides a chemotherapy light option, but in my opinion it does not definitively meet any of the major areas of unmet need that I outlined above in question 10.

2. Yes – no current treatment in this area so could have subsequential benefit (which needs to be offset with the substantial infrastructure improvement needed). Yes – as noted above."
Solriamfetol_for_treating_excessive_daytime_sleepiness_caused_by_narcolepsy.pdf,"1. Slightly different mode of action to current options and may therefore be an important addition to treatment options for this patient group with limited options available. Important addition to treatment options for narcolepsy where there are limited options available. For OSA patients with ongoing sleepiness despite CPAP, this will be a possibility to treat where there is currently no treatment licensed.

2. The technology is not innovative but is an additional therapy in the current management of narcolepsy. The current evidence shows an improvement in some patients who cannot tolerate current treatment and in that group it will certainly be a stepwise improvement but generally the answer would be no. There are a small number of patients that are intolerant of the current therapies and therefore an additional treatment option will be a useful intervention."

Vadadustat_for_treating_symptomatic_anaemia_in_adults_having_dialysis_for_chronic_kidney_disease.pdf,"1. Vadadustat belongs to an innovative class of medication and would be the first HIF-PH inhibitor with NICE endorsement for use in dialysis at the start of treatment. I see this technology as a valuable alternative to ESA therapy. This technology would be a valuable alternative to ESA; perhaps a step forward as opposed to a step change. This technology would be useful for people with an inadequate response to ESA therapy and for people with needle phobia. Vadadustat may also reduce IV iron requirements, but more evidence is required to establish this.

2. This is an innovate technology which has developed from the Nobel prize winning work of the Oxford group under the auspices of Sir Peter Radcliffe.

This technology will add to the nephrologist armoury in the effective management of dialysis patients and in particular those who do not respond to ESA therapy. Health related benefits data is limited at present and it is difficult to comment on this and if this therapy will be better than current therapies; is all one can say is that it is as effective and safety is comparable.

This novel and the more physiological approach may have longer-term benefits as yet not identified including its widespread pleotropic effects which may be positive as in lipids but also negative in other areas. The combination of increasing haemoglobin with endogenous erythropoietin production and improved iron metabolism is very attractive to simplify management.

Certain groups may particularly benefit from this therapy.

3. Yes

"Adalimumab,_etanercept_and_ustekinumab_for_treating_plaque_psoriasis_in_children_and_young_people.pdf","1. Adalimumab may be considered an innovative technology with the potential to make substantial impact on health-related benefits that are unlikely to be included in the QALY calculation including, but not limited to, productivity and caregiver burden. A summary of the adalimumab-related innovation in children and young people with chronic plaque psoriasis is presented below. Adalimumab created a ‘step-change’ in the management of severe chronic plaque psoriasis. It is the only biologic comparing its clinical effectiveness rates against those of the usual standard of care (MTX) in a paediatric population with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Adalimumab has demonstrated to be superior in efficacy (based on PASI 75 response) to methotrexate (MTX), in a head to head, multi centre, double-dummy randomised controlled trial. Adalimumab is also the only biologic treatment indicated in paediatric plaque psoriasis for patients who have not failed prior systemic therapies. As such, adalimumab can be prescribed as a first choice for biologics in patients who inadequately respond or are contraindicated to topical treatments and have no prior exposure to systemic treatments. Therefore, adalimumab offers an additional treatment option for paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis."
Zanubrutinib_for_treating_Waldenstrom’s_macroglobulinaemia.pdf,"1. Yes, it gives different treatment options for patients who would have just had chemoimmunotherapy options. This provides a different way of treating their disease that is well tolerated, leads to improvement in quality of life and from initial trial data would indicate that it is likely to lead to improved length of life. Furthermore, it gives patients access to a class of drugs that we know is active for WM.

2. Yes. It is imperative to have a BTK inhibitor in the treatment armamentarium that we have for treatment of WM, it provides an effective treatment with manageable toxicity profile. It allows us to be able to effectively treat patients who are either unlikely to benefit from chemoimmunotherapy as they have already had it previously or who could not have it for toxicity concerns.

3. For sure- this the product of translational work based on recent understanding of the biology of the disease that allows specific pathway proteins to be targeted by a treatment compared to the relatively blunderbuss approach of chemoimmunotherapy. The technology adds a new mechanism of action with which to tackle the WM disease- and this makes it a step-change in the management of the disease."

Sotagliflozin_with_insulin_for_treating_type_1_diabetes.pdf,"1. Yes.

2. Sotagliflozin is an oral inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2. With the additional mechanism of action on reducing intestinal glucose absorption due to SGLT1 inhibition, sotagliflozin differentiates from SGLT2 inhibitors by reducing postprandial glucose excursion and insulin secretion, as well as by increasing GLP-1 secretion. Sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1c reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies. Sotagliflozin was first assessed in type 2 diabetes, it has been assessed in as an adjuvant treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes in a phase 1 (inTandem1), phase 2 (inTandem2), and phase 3 trial (inTandem3).

In inTandem3, a significantly larger proportion of patients in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group achieved the primary end point of a HbA1c level lower than 7.0% at week 24, with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis after randomization. (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 [15.2%], P<0.001). The mean change from baseline was significantly greater in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group for HbA1c (difference, −0.46 percentage points), weight (−2.98 kg), systolic blood pressure (−3.5 mm Hg), and mean daily bolus dose of insulin (−2.8 units per day) (P≤0.002 for all comparisons). The rate of severe hypoglycemia was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 2.4% [17], respectively). The rate of documented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) or below was significantly lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group."
"Canagliflozin,_dapagliflozin_and_empagliflozin_as_monotherapies_for_treating_type_2_diabetes.pdf","1. Reducing body weight in T2DM patients is an important medical need, however the current NICE recommended monotherapies in patients for whom metformin is not tolerated or is contraindicated i.e. SUs and TZDs, are associated with weight gain and the DPP4s are weight neutral. Repaglinide, as recommended in the draft updated guidelines is also associated with weight gain. In addition, SUs and repaglinide are associated with increased risks of hypoglycaemia. SGLT2s, including dapagliflozin, may represent an innovative approach to monotherapy in these patients because, due to the novel mechanism of action, they are associated with reductions in weight and a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin and SGLT2s represent a new approach for managing T2DM, and have the added advantage of being oral and associated with greater weight reduction properties than other OADs used in monotherapy. However, there are no substantial additional health-related benefits that are not likely to be captured within a QALY calculation."

This acknowledgment highlights both the innovative nature of dupilumab, and the high unmet need for an effective treatment. This position reflects where dupilumab provides the most clinical benefit for patients in England and Wales and the highest unmet need for effective treatment.

2. Yes, this is a highly innovative therapy – the first, targeted biologic mAb in AD, and targets a highly relevant pathway in the disease. This therapy is the greatest advance in the treatment of AD since the introduction of topical corticosteroids. Yes; it treats patients with AD who could not be treated with any currently available systemic therapy. This includes patients who have failed to respond to all current systemic therapies and /or had adverse events precluding their further use.

Selpercatinib_for_advanced_thyroid_cancer_with_RET_alterations_untreated_with_a_targeted_cancer_drug_in_people_12_years_and_over.pdf,"1. Having had some personal experience of using this drug, treating patients participating in the LIBRETTO-531 study, I would say that it does present a step change in the management of this patient group. Apart from the evidence demonstrating improved response rates, progression free survival and overall survival, the drug is so much better tolerated that patients are able to continue usual daily activities, often including continuing to work, where this was previously very unlikely to be possible due to the side effects associated with current standard of care treatments.

2. Yes, this treatment is a 'game-changer' in the era of personalized medicine/targeted therapy. Current care is less effective and more importantly, less well tolerated than the technology with more frequent dose reduction and treatment discontinuation. Patients often put up with side effects that come with current care and these have significant negative impact on both their physical and emotional functionality. Also, as stated above, there needs to be treatment option available for paediatric patients with RET alterations who present with advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer."

Mosunetuzumab_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_follicular_lymphoma.pdf,"1. This technology is the first in class going for approval. As such it is both highly innovative and a step-change in the management of relapsed FL. There is an unmet need to extend the array of treatments to include effective, safe, non-chemotherapy, novel options for patient with FL that have become refractory to standard therapy. Mosunetuzumab is active in refractory disease (70-80% of the enrolled trial population had refractory disease) and provides an additional treatment line for patients with r/r FL, offering a non-cross-resistant, safe and effective novel option to prolong PFS and improve QOL. There is also an unmet need to improve outcomes for patients who experience early disease progression (including so-called POD24 patients). These patients have inferior survival not overcome by standard therapies. Mosunetuzumab is just as effective in POD24, which made up over 50% of the enrolled trial population, than non-POD24. This represents a significant advance in care.

2. The drug is not new in its use in this disease group but would be. Yes, I believe it will make a significant impact in patient care. PF-ILD patients currently have no disease modifying therapies on offer to them to treat the fibrotic component of their disease.

3. As a non-immunosuppressive agent, Nintedanib provides a different novel therapeutic strategy in the armamentarium of immunosuppressives for progressive ILD. Importantly it spares the risk of infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with progressive ILD where further respiratory infection increases mortality risk with potential worsening of lung fibrosis."

The drug works in a slightly different way and appears to have a favourable safety profile compared to existing second and third generation TKIs currently used in this setting.

As asciminib works in a different way to other TKIs, it is innovative – asciminib can overcome kinase domain mutations (KDM), and has less organ toxicity, which has been also detailed in response et the other questions this far. It is likely that there will be less surgical, neurological and cardiological intervention in comparison to ponatinib, the third generation TKI.

Patients have higher chance of responding to therapy, have prolonged PFS and OS.

A cohort of patients may be bridged to a curative line of therapy (CAR-T or allogeneic stem cell transplantation).

Yes this is a ‘step-change’ in the management of the condition

Yes – the unmet need of patients who are older and / or have co-morbidities and who would never be deemed suitable for a stem cell transplant where other options are palliative.

Also bridging therapy to potentially curative therapies as outlined above.

2. Polatuzumab is a novel CD79 antibody targeting and in many ways similar to brentuximab which targets CD30. It is fairly well tolerated in combination with BR chemo regimen and improves response rates and chances of survival for patients with relapsed/ refractory DLBCL. It's an incremental improvement.

2. Yes to reduce treatment burden and especially those who can't keep up with current treatment regimen.

3. We don’t yet have RCT data comparing Faricimab vs Treat and Extend Aflibercept or Ranibizumab treatment. Not a major 'step change' in the management of the condition. The technology may well help with service capacity issues.

4. The innovative nature of this technology in terms of using Ang-2 blockade in partnership with the well-established anti VEGF effect in AMD has the potential to have a significant and substantial impact on patients in terms of reduced injection intervals. This will have benefits for patients and healthcare providers freeing up resources and time to see the growing number of AMD patients. The technology has potential for an incremental step change in improving care of patients with AMD in terms of increased durability in particular. Improved durability and increased injection intervals as seen in the Pivotal Faricimab Phase III studies are very encouraging and the longest intervals that we have seen in Phase III trials adopting this strategy. The repeated injection burden for patients is directly positively influenced by the introduction of the new technology."

Dostarlimab is a novel and innovative immuno-oncology (I-O) therapy that represents a significant step-change for patients with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H EC that has progressed on or after a platinum-containing regimen. Interim analysis data when compared with RWE on current clinical management shows that dostarlimab potentially improves survival for this patient group. Overall, it treats patients with a limited life expectancy and almost no hope of receiving effective treatment.

2. The approval of dostarlimab has the potential to change the way we treat dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer after standard platinum-based chemotherapy, especially given the overall response rate and durability of response that was seen in the GARNET trial.

The technology is viewed as a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses unmet needs of the patient population with a likelihood of response which is low with current treatment, duration of response, progression-free survival and hopefully (likely) overall survival.

4. Yes. This is the first novel biomarker-directed therapy to be licensed in recurrent endometrial cancer. The high disease control rates and durable responses have the potential to change the landscape for the treatment of MMRd recurrent endometrial cancer and offer women with this condition the potential for long-lasting control of their disease which is not achievable with current treatment options."
Selinexor_with_bortezomib_and_dexamethasone_for_previously_treated_multiple_myeloma.pdf,"1. Yes. Quality of life is likely to be improved due to reduced myeloma associated complications. Selinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound that blocks exportin 1 (XPO1) and forces nuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins, inhibits nuclear factor κB, and reduces oncoprotein messenger RNA translation, is a potential novel treatment for myeloma that is refractory to current therapeutic options. Yes because it improves depth of response which correlates with improved survival. This will lead to reduced myeloma associated complications. Myeloma remains an incurable cancer. There is an unmet need to provide better treatments to induce a longer and more durable period of remission and limit, or prevent, myeloma associated complications.

2. This technology improves disease control for patients with myeloma with relapsed disease, limiting disease-related morbidity and improving survivorship. It offers a novel mechanism of action (First-in-Class Nuclear Export Inhibitor)."
"Neratinib_for_extended_adjuvant_treatment_of_hormone_receptor-positive,_HER2-positive_early_stage_breast_cancer_after_adjuvant_trastuzumab.pdf","1. Yes. Patients and their families would be supportive of new technology which may reduce risk of invasive cancer recurrence after HER2 positive early breast cancer diagnosis and standard neo/adjuvant treatment. Anti-diarrhoeal medication and dose modification indicated to allow patient adherence to neratinib and to improve patient quality of life on extended adjuvant HER2 targeted therapy.

2. The technology is innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits over a five year period. In so much as it is a new anti-HER-2 drug that works in the adjuvant setting, it is a step-change in technology, but there are several of these drugs, for which some evidence exists of their benefit but costs and the absolute benefit differ. The technology addresses a particular unmet need in the ER positive, HER-2 positive patients who have undergone Trastuzumab and chemotherapy and are then commencing all adjuvant therapy."
Targeted-release_budesonide_for_treating_primary_IgA_nephropathy.pdf,"1. Yes- this is the first approved treatment for IgAN, it addresses the fundamentals of the pathogenesis of the disease and is most definitely a ‘step-change’ in the management of the condition. Unmet need—there are no approved therapies for IgAN."
Lenvatinib_for_untreated_advanced_hepatocellular_carcinoma.pdf,1. Improved survival with no current alternative treatments in a condition with an overall short survival time.
Regorafenib_for_previously_treated_metastatic_colorectal_cancer.pdf,1. This drug approval would allow UK patients with mCRC to access a NICE-approved anti-angiogenic for the first time (with this class of agents being commonly used for these patients across the world). There are no alternative agents in third-line for those in whom trifluridine-tipiracil is contra-indicated or thought to have minimal chance of benefit. There are no alternative agents in the fourth-line setting. This would offer an alternative to trifluridine/tipiracil in third-line to the patients who are deemed unlikely on the criteria above to have benefit from this agent. It would also offer a new therapy following trifluridine/tipiracil in the fourth-line setting for a subgroup of fit and motivated patients.
Tofacitinib_for_moderately_to_severely_active_ulcerative_colitis.pdf,"1. Yes. Orally administered. Small molecule so reduced chance of immunogenicity compared to monoclonal antibody therapies. Good side-effect profile. For reasons stated above. Yes. See above.

2. Yes, the technology is considered innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits as it introduces an alternative mode of action and route of administration. It also addresses an unmet need for those who have failed or are intolerant to other biologics."

Atogepant_for_preventing_migraine.pdf,"1. Yes – This technology may be better than the currently NICE approved Gepant for the following reasons:
- Patient adherence to a daily tablet is likely to be better rather than an alternate day tablet.
- The pharmacology (Plasma half-life) of this technology is scientifically more plausible (tablets given daily) than the alternate day Gepant previously approved by NICE which has the same half-life but is still given alternate days."

Pembrolizumab_for_untreated_metastatic_or_unresectable_recurrent_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Yes. The improved 3 year survival is dramatic and unprecedented for this patient group and this is the first time an immune targeted therapy has shown activity in the first line setting. The main unmet need which this study addresses is that these patients die of their disease despite the current therapy with most being dead within a year and almost all being dead within 3 years.

2. Pembrolizumab if compared with second line palliative chemotherapy can be considered innovative and can have a substantial impact on health-related benefits particularly with relation to overall survival and safety profile, but Immunotherapy with Nivolumab has already been available for these groups of patients via CDF. Yes when compared to second line palliative chemotherapy."

2. The treatment is an immunotherapy, which in itself is innovative within this tumour type. It also addresses an area of unmet need – currently this group of patients faces a poor prognosis with response rates of 10-15% to current second line chemo, with typically just a few months of progression free time. This new treatment increases response rates to 40% with a durable response –a real tenable, meaningful difference. This is certainly a huge step change in the management of this condition."
Daratumumab_monotherapy_for_treating_relapsed_and_refractory_multiple_myeloma.pdf,1. This is an established therapy that has demonstrated benefit when used as a monotherapy for patients who have not had prior exposure to anti-CD38 targeting treatment. Daratumumab was the first approved monoclonal antibody for myeloma and is viewed as a step change in treatment. It is associated with excellent responses and duration of response in a significant proportion of heavily pre-treated patients.

Tucatinib_with_trastuzumab_and_capecitabine_for_treating_HER2-positive_advanced_breast_cancer_after_2_or_more_anti-HER2_therapies.pdf,"1. Yes, this technology can be considered to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. The tucatinib label specifies that patients should have received one or more prior HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting which reflects the HER2CLIMB population. The protocol required previous trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1 but did not specify the setting (early or metastatic) and did not stipulate a number for prior lines of therapy. The approved indication for tucatinib does not list prior therapies by name to allow for flexibility and ensure continued access if the treatment landscape for HER2-positive MBC changes in the future. The treatment after 1st (trastuzumab, herceptin and taxane) and 2nd (TDM1) line therapy is suboptimal compared with the use of the tucatinib combination as described above, particularly in those patients with brain involvement.

2. Yes. This is an important drug combination to control brain metastases for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer in addition to being an effective therapy for patients without brain metastases. Yes, patients with brain metastases have a particular unmet need.

3. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?

Nivolumab_for_adjuvant_treatment_of_invasive_urothelial_cancer_at_high_risk_of_recurrence.pdf,"1. Yes. Given that these patients mostly receive no adjuvant treatment, Nivolumab would represent a significant innovation. 

Yes, this is an unmet need – see answers above.

2. Yes; Moving Immune check point inhibitor from advanced metastatic setting into earlier setting as adjuvant treatment, where Improvement in DFS is likely to translate into improvement in OS and higher percentage of patients achieving cure is likely to be a “step change ‘in the management of urothelial cancer. The clinical gains is likely to impact on improvement in QOL."
Danicopan_with_ravulizumab_or_eculizumab_for_treating_paroxysmal_nocturnal_haemoglobinuria.pdf,"1. Yes, I believe that there will be improvement in health-related benefits. There is potential reduction in transfusion requirement, reduced need for iron chelation, reduced hospital visits for transfusion. Yes, they do. As PNH is a rare disease, the patients participating in the clinical trials reflect the real-world experience.

2. Yes, if the word residual haemolytic anaemia is used after ensuring that intravascular haemolysis is well controlled on C5 inhibitor.

3. Yes, it is innovative and will significantly improve the health of patients. Proximal complement inhibition in PNH is a step change in treatment and addresses an unmet need. Unmet need: Danicopan is a proximal complement inhibitor and prevents extravascular haemolysis which is a phenomenon of treatment with C5 inhibition. With the addition of danicopan to C5 inhibition haemoglobin increases to near normal/normal enables patients to improve their quality of life and productivity."
Berotralstat_for_preventing_recurrent_attacks_of_hereditary_angioedema.pdf,"1. Yes – only similar alternative currently is attenuated androgen therapy with significant adverse effects and contraindications. Depending on commissioning criteria could benefit patients with moderate to severe activity of disease. Currently effective prophylaxis (non-androgen based) is only accessible to individuals with >2 clinically significant swellings a week – these individuals have to be considered as extremely severe disease. This technology should enable effective therapy for those with moderate to severe disease not meeting the criteria for current prophylaxis. 

•	Is the technology a ‘step-change’ in the management of the condition? Yes

•	Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population? Yes as above and before.

2. Yes, the technology would be the first effective oral medication specifically designed for prevention of HAE attacks. Yes, it provides an effective oral prophylactic medication for patients with HAE who do not qualify for prophylactic treatment with C1 inhibitor or lanadelumab. This is particularly relevant as the two main oral medications currently in use have limitations i.e., androgens/danazol is unlicensed, have limited global supply, side effects, and is not suitable in children; and tranexamic acid is ineffective in most patients with HAE.

4. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

5. The technology is considered innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits as it will help to control and reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of swelling, leading to less use of rescue medication and less reliance on health care and carers, thereby, potentially offering psychological benefits not only for patients but also carers. It is particularly beneficial for those with limited ability to self-treat with injections, where there are contraindications to other therapies, or where other therapies are not available. Moreover, it represents a novel agent and use of the oral route for preventative therapy, providing effective prophylaxis to a group currently without any preventive therapy and is seen as a 'step-change' in the management of the condition."
Liposomal_cytarabine–daunorubicin_for_untreated_acute_myeloid_leukaemia.pdf,"1. CPX-351 is a lamellar-encapsulated vehicle that delivers daunorubicin and cytarabine in a fixed molar ratio with enhanced incorporation into the bone marrow and AML cells. While not strictly a ‘targeted’ therapy, in that there is no specific molecular target or determinant of response, this drug is a formulation of chemotherapy that allows more effective delivery to the malignant cells – so, in a way, it really is a targeted agent. Clinical experience has shown that it is well tolerated with a favorable toxicity profile compared to standard DA 3+10 chemotherapy. Yes. There has been no improvement in the outcome of this group of patients for many years. Many patients are resistant to standard chemotherapy and do not make it to a BMT. Yes. By increasing CR rate, reducing relapse risk and delivering more patients to the possibility of allo transplant and cure.

2. This is the first example of utilisation of ‘combiplex’ technology in AML- which proposes a more targeted/synergistic delivery of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The published (in abstract) phase 3 data in the pre-specified sub-populations of AML indicates improved response with lower toxicity. The pre-specified sub-populations of AML are those with a particularly poor outcome. This is due to a reduced remission and increased relapse rate compared to primary/standard AML. As such CPX-351 appears to improve the response rate- such that more patients are able to undergo curative stem cell transplantation (34% vs 25 %) after CPX-351 compared to standard therapy. Additionally the transplant related complications were lower in the CPX-351 treated patients.

3. Yes. CPX 351 is the first example of utilisation of ‘complex’ technology in AML- which delivers a more targeted/synergistic combination of chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in superior PK/PD than achieved by the same drugs as free agents. There is evidence of sparing non haematopoetic tissue and preferential localisation in the BM, in animal models. This achieves higher effective drug levels in the BM and thereby exposure and internalising in leukaemic cells. Bypassing the efflux mechanisms in the cell membranes may explain better efficacy in high risk AML’s which are more likely to be chemoresistant. The published (in abstract) phase 3 data in the pre-specified sub-populations of AML indicates improved response with lower toxicity.

Yes. This is the first development in the treatment of AML showing improvement in overall survival without excess toxicity, over the conventional DA3+10 which has been used for decades. Easier/ outpatient delivery of the drug is also a welcome change from resource utilisation, to the prolonged hospital stay with standard treatment."

Belimumab_for_treating_active_autoantibody-positive_systemic_lupus_erythematosus.pdf,"1. Lupus treatment has evolved by incremental steps. Outcomes are clearly better than 20 or more years ago. Belimumab provides a further incremental benefit. It is one of only three treatments that actually holds a licence for use in lupus. Clinical trial evidence suggests that significant benefits are seen for a proportion of patients. With any chronic and complex disease, there remain uncertainties about the overall impact on long-term outcomes, but this evidence is impossible to provide unless we can bring the treatment into more widespread usage. Existing evidence suggests there is a reasonable correlation between short-term outcomes in lupus (disease activity and steroid dosage) and long-term damage (the really health affecting and costly consequences such as renal failure), so it is reasonable to assume this long-term benefits are likely is short-term responses are observed. Belimumab is a step change in so far as it has emerged as one of only three licenced therapeutics for lupus and has a now growing record of successful trial data and post-licensing observational data. Clinically, it is probably best regarded as an important incremental treatment strategy.

2. Yes – already showing benefits to patients:
- Reduced steroid use
- Reduced pill burden
- Improved quality of life
- SC administration will be beneficial to adherent patients requiring more autonomy.

As described above – shared care pathways will improve overall management of patients with lupus – build links, facilitate rapid referral to centre when needed, encourage less use of steroids etc.

3. Reduced corticosteroids side-effects. Already in use. Already in use but was a step-change when introduced as only biological therapy currently licensed for SLE. Uncontrolled SLE."
"Palbociclib_with_fulvestrant_for_treating_hormone_receptor-positive,_HER2-negative_advanced_breast_cancer_after_endocrine_therapy.pdf","1. Palbociclib is recognized as a transformative technology with potential to significantly impact health-related benefits, mainly in the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Its innovative mechanism enhances the effect of endocrine therapy by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6, which are essential in the proliferation of breast cancer cells. This results in improved progression-free survival with manageable adverse effects, addressing an unmet medical need by offering an effective treatment option where existing therapies are limited. The technology is presented as being capable of making a substantial contribution to treating a disease with high unmet need, substantially improving the way needs are met in the current therapeutic landscape.

2. CDK4/6 inhibitors are seen by many experts internationally as the most important treatment development for breast cancer in the last 20 years. This is reflected in the four existing NICE approvals for CDK4/6 inhibitors, and the widespread adoption into evidence based guidelines.

3. The CDK 4/6 inhibitor drugs have made a dramatic difference to the quality of life and longevity for patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer. As described above, there are specific clinical scenarios where ribociclib/fulvestrant and abemaciclib/fulvestrant are not indicated on the Cancer Drugs Fund and the addition of palbociclib/fulvestrant would enable these patients to access high quality care that they would otherwise not get. The major step change was the introduction of CDK 4/6 inhibitors more generally. However, it is essential that as many patients as possible can access this safe and effective treatment."
Cabozantinib_for_previously_treated_advanced_differentiated_thyroid_cancer_unsuitable_for_or_refractory_to_radioactive_iodine.pdf,"1. Substantial health benefits are likely to be realized based on data from the COSMIC trial which demonstrated that Cabozantinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with radio-resistant and progressive metastatic disease. Current second line treatment options for progressive (and radioresistant) DTC are limited in the UK, with patients getting best supportive care after treatment failures with drugs like Sorafenib and Levatinib.

Treatment with Cabozantinib offers a credible therapeutic option to patients in this group and the safety and efficacy of the drug have been evaluated in the COSMIC 311 Trial. Cabozantinib showed significant improvement in progression-free survival over placebo. Cabozantinib therefore is a viable therapeutic option with the potential to reduce disease burden and improve progression free survival. A drug that offers this therapeutic response in eligible patients is clearly a significant step compared to offering only best supportive care to patients with progressive metastatic radio-resistant disease.

2. Yes- currently there is no active treatment available for the majority of these patients and their prognosis is very poor, so it is addressing a significant unmet need."
Venetoclax_with_obinutuzumab_for_untreated_chronic_lymphocytic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Treatment with Ibrutinib in relapsed patients has shown significant improvement not only in disease control, prolonging survival but also in restoring quality of life. VenO is likely to deliver similar outcome but with limited duration treatment.

2. Yes, it is likely that a significant number of the MRD negative patients are cured. For example, 51% of patients treated with Ven-Obi were in a deep molecular MRD at 10^-6 by sequencing. Yes, thanks to its tolerability and high MRD and PFS results.

3. The response area for the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?' from the images you provided is blank, indicating no response was recorded there."
Lanadelumab_for_preventing_recurrent_attacks_of_hereditary_angioedema.pdf,"1. The response to the question in the images is not provided within the visible text portions. The spaces for answers are blank.

2. Yes, for patients with severe or unresponsive disease. Although, the long term effects of this technology are not known and there is a need for long term post-marketing surveillance.

3. This is certainly innovative and represents the first targeted monoclonal therapy for HAE with a treatment interval of up to 4 weekly. Yes for the reasons outlined above. In patients that remain uncontrolled or are unable to take anabolic steroids this technology provides a suitable alternative that is more convenient than Cl-inhibitor concentrate which is administered 3x weekly."
Sapropterin_for_treating_hyperphenylalaninaemia_in_phenylketonuria.pdf,"1. Yes. Treatment adherence is low with dietary management in all age groups. By adulthood, it is known that 79% of adults fail to control their blood phenylalanine levels within target range even though lifelong treatment is recommended. Some patients describe moving in and out of dietary treatment but struggle to recommence dietary treatment. Probably 50% of adult patients have stopped diet completely because they are unable to adhere to it. It is unrealistic to expect patients to maintain such a restrictive diet when this is so difficult to apply on a day to day basis. Therefore for 20-30% of patients with PKU, sapropterin will offer an alternative treatment that is easy to administer and will substantially lessen the need for 'Foods for Special Purposes.’ For these patients it will ensure that they can be prescribed a treatment they are able to adhere to, maintain their blood Phe within target reference range for their age and substantially increase their natural protein tolerance.

2. Overall, the benefits expected are chiefly in reduction in the burden of the current PKU diet therapy and hence improved quality of life. For some patients these benefits might be significant, as might be the improvement in Phe control, particularly if adherence to current PKU diet is very difficult. Although there have been significant improvements in the tolerability of the standard dietary therapy, for those PKU patients who are Sapropterin responsive, this would represent the first major innovation in therapy in 50 years since dietary therapy was introduced. For some patients (& parents who are providing the diet for their children), the daily burden and complexity of the current PKU diet is high. Sapropterin would offer an alternative therapy for those that are responsive, with potential to improve Phe control and increase natural dietary protein intake (i.e. return to a more normal liberalised diet).

3. Yes – reducing the burden of diet and its impact on the family unit. May allow more social inclusiveness.

4. I agree with the submission by the NSPKU

5. No. This is just an adjunct to our current management. The simplest way to think of it is that in some patients it can reduce the baseline Phe level. No. A small number of babies with hyperphenylalaninaemia might be able to avoid dietary treatment in childhood. Only partially. Most patients will still need to maintain a low protein diet."
Trifluridine–tipiracil_for_treating_metastatic_gastric_cancer_or_gastro-oesophageal_junction_adenocarcinoma_after_2_or_more_treatments.pdf,"1. Yes, currently there is no active treatment available for patients who have progressed through 2 lines of therapy in the advanced gastric setting. This technology significantly improves survival compared to the current standard of care (BSC) and is also given orally, which is an option not available in either first or second line treatment. This is the first global study to show efficacy (survival benefit) in this indication, addressing a particular unmet need of the patient population.

2. Yes, there has not been any high quality evidence of a treatment which improved survival for patients in this setting before. Yes, it is considered a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses the need for effective treatment which can improve survival."
Pembrolizumab_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_classical_Hodgkin_lymphoma_after_stem_cell_transplant_or_at_least_2_previous_therapies.pdf,"1. Amplification of PD-1 ligands is now known to be a defining feature of Hodgkin lymphoma. Checkpoint inhibitors have unprecedented single agent efficacy in this disease. The optimum use of PD-1 inhibitors is yet to be defined, but there is a strong pre-clinical rationale for bringing them into the treatment pathway earlier, at a point when patients are less immunosuppressed and able to mount effective anti-tumour immune responses. Yes, for transplant-unfit patients in particular.

2. PD1 inhibitors are hugely innovative and have revolutionised cancer medicine. This appraisal however is more about defining their place in the pathway. It enables a high rate of durable responses earlier on the treatment pathway, and a bridge to transplant for younger patients."
Alectinib_for_untreated_ALK-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. The impact on prevention and treatment of brain metastases is absolutely critical. Development and/or progression of brain metastases is a physically and psychologically devastating event which grossly affects quality of life. Any treatment that reduces the incidence of brain metastases is welcome, as is any agent that can treat existing brain metastases without the need for neurosurgery or cranial radiotherapy. On the basis of the evidence available Alectinib achieves both of these (ALEX study). Yes – the huge difference in progression free survival for patients with brain metastases treated with Alectinib compared to Crizotinib (ALEX study), is indicative of the step-change. Yes – control and prevention of brain metastases.

2. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

3. No. whilst it is probably an improved strategy to use alectinib up front compared to crizotinib followed by a 2nd generation ALK inhibitor such as alectinib or ceritinib this has not formally been answered within a clinical trial as yet.

The progression free survival and brain disease control seen with agent in the ALEX study suggest that it is a significant “step-up” from the present standard of care.

Yes. These patients have high rates of central nervous system metastases. Alectinib delays the onset of these metastases which can be difficult to treat.

4. Yes. The main innovation relates to CNS penetration and excellent control of intracranial disease. Additionally, it seems to have a favorable toxicity profile.

The efficacy data is a paradigm shift in the 1st line treatment of this disease and it is likely to make a substantial and significant impact on QoL. Predominantly by being less toxic, preventing the development of brain mets and delaying the progression of existing brain mets."

"Alpelisib_with_fulvestrant_for_treating_hormone_receptor-positive,_HER2-negative,_PIK3CA-mutated_advanced_breast_cancer.pdf","1. Alpelisib with fulvestrant is a 'step change' as it is the only treatment to be evaluated for the PIK3CA +ve patients both after endocrine monotherapy (randomised SOLAR-1 registration trial see above) and prospectively evaluated following CDK4/6 inhibitors (ByLieve study see above). This targeted agent allows for individualised care, with a greater potential for response rather than the ‘one size fits all’ approach of chemotherapy. Other options such as Everolimus have not been evaluated in this setting and have significant pulmonary toxicity which has become a concern more recently with the Coronavirus pandemic and both the risk of contracting COVID-19 and diagnostic uncertainty.

2. Yes: because it is a targeted therapy (to PIK3CA) going beyond simply treating all patients with HR positive HER2 negative breast cancer in the same/similar manner."
Durvalumab_with_etoposide_and_either_carboplatin_or_cisplatin_for_untreated_extensive-stage_small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1.

However, durvalumab was innovative in improving overall survival over chemotherapy alone at the time the CASPIAN trial reported."
Etelcalcetide_for_treating_secondary_hyperparathyroidism.pdf,NULL
Elafibranor_for_previously_treated_primary_biliary_cholangitis.pdf,"1. Elafibranor is a new technology that has a different mode of action compared to the current second-line reimbursed treatment OCA, providing a clinically and cost-effective alternative for clinicians and patients to choose from. As described in section 3i, there are additional benefits that have not been captured within the model. Elafibranor may have a benefit on carers in reducing the burden they experience in looking after or supporting a person with PBC. Another advantage for elafibranor compared to OCA is that dose-titration is not required. OCA should be started at a dose of 5 mg once daily for the first 6 months and after this, if patients who are tolerating OCA and have not achieved an adequate reduction in ALP or TB, the dose is increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. Elafibranor’s dose is 80 mg once daily as a single tablet and no dose adjustment is required during treatment.

2. Elafibranor has a novel mode of action, though part of its activity overlaps with that of fibrates (PPAR-alpha agonists) and therefore it is innovative. The impact it will make in terms of the proportion of patients with PBC who have a durable response to treatment, which leads to a reduced liver-related mortality or the need for liver transplantation, is currently unclear.

3. No.

4. Elafibranor will, in my view, be an important addition to the therapeutic option that we have for PBC. This will, however, be an incremental advance over obeticholic acid rather than a step-change (the advent of the first second-line therapy obeticholic acid was indeed a step change). The unmet need that is addressed is a second-line therapy option for PBC patients with significant itch, where use of obeticholic acid might be regarded as undesirable, and as an alternative second-line therapy in PBC who develop significant itch with obeticholic acid that is not responsive to standard management approaches. The extent to which elafibranor will be useful as a therapy specifically for itch treatment (i.e. patients who need itch control therapy but in whom second-line therapy is not indicated; an area with limited licensed therapies but not, as far as I understand, a proposed labelled indication for elafibranor) will become clear if and when we have clinical access. With the caveat that long-term data are needed the side-effect profile and drug tolerability represent major advantages of the drug. Given the lack of significant side-effects, and the positive effect on itch, elafibranor is a net improver of PBC patient quality life. This is important in a condition where quality of life issues are frequently an important factor."
Avatrombopag_for_treating_primary_chronic_immune_thrombocytopenia.pdf,"1. Efficacy and tolerance appear similar to other TPO RAs, but there are additional benefits outlined in question 13. The relatively quick onset of action (65% had responded by day 8 in the main phase III study) compared with other TPO RA may enable clinicians to avoid steroid rescue for some patients. No, this is a drug within the class of existing TPO RA. However not all patients respond to existing TPO RA and the class of drug is particularly valuable for patients because they do not suppress the immune system. Greater patient convenience over a subcutaneous injection and no dietary restrictions. Despite their potential side effects, the HRQoL is often improved in responding patients to this class of drug (TPO RA) The published data on tolerance for avatrombopag does not appear greatly different from other treatments in this class. Advantages are convenience (oral, no dietary restriction) and potential to reduce steroid burden.

2. There are some clear advantages from a patient perspective, particularly the lack of the dietary restrictions required for eltrombopag, which can be forgotten or confused by older patients who take calcium or dairy products that reduce absorption of eltrombopag, leading to breakthrough thrombocytopenia."

Mogamulizumab_for_previously_treated_mycosis_fungoides_and_Sézary_syndrome.pdf,"1. Yes, it provides a safe and effective therapy for MF/SS and will provide a new treatment option for patients who have no further lines of therapy available and are suffering painful itchy and disfiguring skin lesions.

2. Yes in that it provides evidence of benefit for the group of patients who have a particularly aggressive disease course and poor outcomes. For some patients, it may treat and stabilise their lymphoma and allow a stem cell transplant. Yes in that more effective therapies are required, in particular therapies without significant toxicities that can be continued until progression.

3. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

4. Yes it provides a safe and effective therapy for MF/SS and will provide a new treatment option for patients who have no further lines of therapy available and are suffering painful itchy and disfiguring skin lesions."
Everolimus_with_exemestane_for_treating_advanced_breast_cancer_after_endocrine_therapy.pdf,1. The Committee acknowledged that the mechanism of action of everolimus may offer a step change in treatment by restoring sensitivity of the tumor to endocrine therapy.

Sofosbuvir–velpatasvir–voxilaprevir_for_treating_chronic_hepatitis_C.pdf,"1. The technology addresses an unmet need in the patient population by providing treatment that is free from ribavirin, has a shorter duration, and can be deployed easily across various settings including difficult-to-access patient groups. While not considered a step-wise change in managing the condition, its innovative approach lies in its potential to achieve widespread usage with minimal side effect profile and without the need for genotype or disease staging prior to use.

2. The trial data that I have seen suggests these are more potent agents with a more pan-genotypic profile and with possibly a higher barrier to resistance than some of the current DAA drugs. Introduction of DAA therapy was a step-change. Introduction of second generation DAA drugs will improve SVR12 rates from very high to extremely high. Yes for those patients who have failed DAA containing regimens.

3. There are currently no/limited options for treating and curing those individuals that have failed DAA-based regimens. This technology would provide a significant impact and benefits in this scenario. Only for those that have failed previous DAA-based regimens. In this scenario then I consider it a 'step-change', but not in other populations."

Entrectinib_for_treating_ROS1-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Lung cancer has become a disease of multiple molecular sub-types and there has been very clear and tangible benefits in using molecularly targeted therapies. ROS1 fusion represents 1-2% of the NSCLC (non-squamous) population and there is no doubt that targeting this molecular driver results in clear patient benefit. To date, crizotinib is the only agent available for targeting this pathway but was not designed initially as a specific ROS1 inhibitor, therefore, has less specificity for the target. Entrectinib is a multikinase inhibitor but selectively inhibits ROS/ALK/TRK and has 40x greater affinity for the ROS1 target than crizotinib. The data to date support the superior efficacy of entrectinib although it is extremely challenging to undertake a randomised controlled trial to compare the agents due to the low prevalence of the alteration and time that would be required to undertake such a study. Nonetheless, there is clear evidence for the CNS activity which could provide a step-change in the management of this condition and reduce morbidity."
Cabotegravir_with_rilpivirine_for_treating_HIV-1.pdf,"1. For a small number of patients, with specialist support, this technology has the potential to improve health-related benefits. For example, NHIVNA members were involved in initiating a patient onto injectable ART. This patient was accepted on compassionate grounds. For the first time they reached undetectable levels and the injectable ART were administered in the patient’s home each month. This has transformed the patient’s life and significantly reduced the risk of onward transmission. Potentially, for a small number of patients but not for the majority of people who adhere well to oral ART.

2. New and innovative technologies are often taken up by people who are well informed and fully engaged with a service. Although this technology may be useful for a small number of people in this group, we believe that its main potential lies in its ability to engage the small number of people with HIV in England who do not, or will not, take oral ART and have difficulty engaging with HIV services because of this.  

Investment in nursing workforce needed if widespread use of the technology is to be introduced. Use of this technology in patients with complex needs is vital, as is the specialist support to ensure this. Most people with HIV in England adhere well to oral ART and are likely to continue to do so. This technology will increase the amount and level of resources needed to deliver an HIV service. Ensuring equality and access to this technology in marginalised groups is vital."

Sebelipase_alfa_for_treating_lysosomal_acid_lipase_deficiency_that_is_not_Wolman_disease_(terminated_appraisal).pdf,"1. LAL Deficiency is a serious, debilitating and multi-systemic disease that results in early mortality. Onset of LAL Deficiency is from birth, and affects all ages, but mainly presents as a paediatric disease. In the absence of an effective therapy, infants with this condition die before the age of 6 months. Liver failure is the main cause of death, though patients are also at risk of fatal cardiovascular events (Bernstein, 2013).

The disease represents a significant unmet medical need because there are currently no available treatment options that specifically correct the biological cause of the condition. Current therapies are supportive in nature and consist of lipid-lowering therapies, haematopoietic stem cell, and liver transplantation. These therapies do not address the underlying defect in LAL Deficiency and do not appear to substantially modify the outcome in affected patients (Hoeg, 1984; Meyers, 1985; Data on File, CSR LAL-1-NH01). Surgical interventions in particular are associated with complications and increased morbidity/mortality.

Sebelipase alfa is innovative and represents a step-change in the management of this multi-systemic, life-limiting condition because:
- It is the first pharmacological treatment approved for the treatment of LAL Deficiency.
- It is approved for use in LAL Deficiency patients of all ages.
- It is the first treatment option (pharmacological or otherwise) that addresses the underlying biological cause of LAL Deficiency. Sebelipase alfa is an ERT: therapy aims to replace deficient enzyme and prevent the damage caused by accumulation of its substrate, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides.
- Sebelipase alfa substantially improves survival in infants compared to current supportive care.
- Sebelipase alfa significantly improved markers of chronic liver injury compared to placebo, potentially reversing liver damage and improving liver outcomes in children and adults thus improving quality of life and survival.
- Sebelipase alfa significantly improved dyslipidaemia compared to placebo, supporting its role in treating the underlying cause of disease and reducing cardiovascular risk."
Lutetium-177_vipivotide_tetraxetan_for_treating_PSMA-positive_hormone-relapsed_metastatic_prostate_cancer_after_2_or_more_treatments.pdf,"1. Yes.

2. Radioligand therapy has a significant potential in changing outlook in MCRPC and hopefully in MHSPC in future. This innovative technology has increased optimism for patients in MCRPC setting who have limited options. This treatment is given every 6 weeks in comparison with Cabazitaxel chemotherapy which is delivered every 3 weeks. Given the constraints across the chemotherapy departments in the NHS, this treatment will potentially reduce the demand for chemotherapy chair and facility time as this treatment will be delivered in either the nuclear medicine units or molecular therapy units.

3. The technology is a targeted therapy and will be a game changer. It is a new mechanism of action utilizing the principle of theranostics. If available it will give an additional option of treatment for patients with PSMA positive mCRPC in a stage of disease where there is an unmet need."

The text mainly discusses other topics related to health conditions, treatments, and equality issues. There is no visible connection or continuation of the given question in the text excerpts from the images.

2. Yes, the second anti-IL17 for HS and provides a much-needed alternative to adalimumab. The opportunity to switch biologic therapy will ensure that biologics are started at an appropriate time to prevent scarring, rather than being reserved until substantial scarring has developed, reducing the need for surgery which has high impact on patients and the NHS.

3. Yes – first IL 17 A and F inhibitor. Gives higher efficacy and improved quality of life compared to other drugs.

4. The response to the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?' is:

- Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
- Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?"
Upadacitinib_for_treating_active_psoriatic_arthritis_after_inadequate_response_to_DMARDs.pdf,"1. JAK inhibitors do improve skin psoriasis as well as arthritis - so there will be additional benefits to patients skin psoriasis, which are not particularly well reflected in QALY calculations (if these are based on EQ5D). Softer benefits (such as improvements in fatigue) may not be captured well by EQ5D and hence QALYs etc.) Oral medications will not require the same level of infrastructure (sharps bins, regular homecare deliveries etc.)

This is a useful additional JAK inhibitor medicine, but it is not particularly more innovative than the already established and prescribed tofacitinib. However, this will not be quite the same as other ‘me too’ introduction / launches of medication. Response rates and side effect profiles can be more heterogeneous in JAK inhibitors as a group, as there are differences between the differing JAK inhibitors related to the amount of JAK1/2/3 and TYK 2 inhibition."
Tocilizumab_for_treating_giant_cell_arteritis.pdf,"1. The technology is both innovative for this indication and has the potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. This is the first real advance in the management of giant cell arteritis since 1955.

2. By definition this drug is innovative for the treatment of GCA being the only agent for whom controlled clinical trial data is available. Although the evidence is yet to be obtained, extrapolation of the phase II and phase III data on the reduction of cumulative steroid burden would suggest that there will be significant health benefits, particularly for those in whom steroid therapy confers a significant added risk or in those in whom steroid therapy is inadequate. Longer term impacts might include the potential for disease 'cure', better control of aortic disease in those with large vessel GCA and hence reduced risk of aortic dilatation, efficacy in those considered at high risk of visual loss. However, I must emphasize that data is lacking in all these areas.

3. The technology is currently the only targeted treatment for GCA with a phase three trial evidence to support its use in GCA. It will improve the long-term health of these patients, compared to the current standard of care with glucocorticoid treatment. Yes, absolutely. Yes, targeted therapy."
Dostarlimab_with_platinum-based_chemotherapy_for_treating_advanced_or_recurrent_endometrial_cancer_with_high_microsatellite_instability_or_mismatch_repair_deficiency.pdf,"1. Yes. This is the first novel biomarker-directed therapy to be licensed as part of the first-line treatment of advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer. The substantial improvements in both PFS and OS seen in the RUBY trial and the durable responses seen with first line dostarlimab are a step-change in the treatment of MMR-deficient advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and offer women with this condition the potential for long-lasting control of their disease and extended survival which is not achievable with current treatment options. The movement of immunotherapy into the first-line setting will open this treatment option up to larger numbers of potentially eligible patients who may not be fit enough to receive subsequent second-line therapy.

2. I consider that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy represents a step change in the management of MMR deficient primary advanced endometrial cancer.

The addition of dostarlimab, guided by biomarkers, addresses an important unmet need in the management of advanced/relapsed endometrial cancer.

3. The text from the images related to the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?' is not specifically outlined in the provided images.

Brexucabtagene_autoleucel_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_mantle_cell_lymphoma.pdf,"1. Yes – this is a very innovative approach in mantle cell lymphoma and represents a clear development from the standard of care therapies that are available now. This therapeutic approach looks to improve on the overall response rates of patients with heavily pre-treated MCL post BTK inhibition for which there is no clear standard of care therapy at present.

2. This is a highly innovative technology and a major step forward in the care of patients with MCL. Yes. It offers a distinct mechanism of action, high chance of response and prolonged progression free survival.

Hybrid_closed_loop_systems_for_managing_blood_glucose_levels_in_type_1_diabetes.pdf,"1. This technology is a big step change in managing type 1 diabetes. In our experience, reduction in HbA1c and improved TIR appears consistent across most groups, HbA1c ranges and duration of diabetes. Considerable improvements in symptoms for those with complications of diabetes, especially gastroparesis and neuropathy.

2. Hybrid closed loop systems for managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes

3. Yes this is what we have always worked towards i.e. the artificial pancreas. This is the only therapy that replaces insulin in a physiological manner with reduced risks of either over or under treatment. The technology would allow more patients to safely attain the NICE goal for glycosylated haemoglobin.

4. Yes, to all. It improves current need by: Reducing mental burden of day-to-day management of their condition, Improved night time control (and sleep), Improved ability to focus on work tasks, Less high glucose levels and less hypos with less efforts.

5. The integration of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy will improve glycaemic control and reduce risk of diabetes related complications. It has been shown that in the same patient overnight insulin requirements can vary by up to 30%, the integrated system can help adjust the basal insulin without the patient or their parent getting up to correct high or low glucose levels. Daytime insulin requirements can also vary hugely not only with varied food intake but also with changes in emotions, pubertal hormones, stress levels and exercise. The integrated system can help overcome some of these variations. This does result in a 'step-change' in the management of diabetes."
Apalutamide_with_androgen_deprivation_therapy_for_treating_hormone-sensitive_metastatic_prostate_cancer.pdf,"1. The novel hormonal therapies (including Apalutamide) make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and would be categorised as an innovation.

This technology represents a step change for patients in terms of quality of life and control of disease for those patients who have failed HC and have uncontrolled symptoms and uncontrolled myeloproliferation. I wish to emphasize that ALL randomised clinical trials conducted with this agent have demonstrated this.

2. Yes, as already mentioned for some patients with HC-intolerant or resistant PV, ruxolitinib can be life changing and so for those it does represent a step change improvement. It improves the way current need is met by offering a therapeutic approach that actually works in delivering enhanced QoL, rather than the currently available options."
Tirzepatide_for_treating_type_2_diabetes.pdf,1. The creation of the first incretin dual-receptor agonist may be a step-change improvement in the management of type 2 diabetes.

Lorlatinib_for_untreated_ALK-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. There are already effective treatment options in the ALK treatment naïve population. However, if Lorlatinib provides a further survival benefit then it is a substantial and significant benefit. Also, if it is better at controlling CNS disease – then again this is a significant improvement. Potentially will provide a greater survival benefit as well as better CNS disease control.

2. I do not regard this as a step change however as described above the control of central nervous system disease is an important unmet medical need in this population.

3. Yes – this is potentially a treatment than can improve clinical outcomes compared with current standard of care."

2. Yes this is step change in the management of MF, in particularly anaemia. It addresses the triad of spleen and symptom burdens and also anaemia. It has demonstrable activity in the JAK 1 naive and also JAK 1 exposed populations. Using one agents to address these issues is much more concise for the patient and clinician and avoids inadequate dose density of rux/ fedratinib (with suboptimal responses), and the need for adjunctive drugs such as danazol or recombinant erythropoietin."
Palforzia_for_treating_peanut_allergy_in_children_and_young_people.pdf,"1. Yes and will be welcomed by peanut allergy sufferers. It is the first disease modifying treatment available.

2. Yes but only in the sense that all OIT is innovative. Packaging of peanut into capsules seems to be a detail rather than the innovation itself however, if this is what makes the delivery of peanut OIT safe and accessible then yes, for some patients, this will provide important clinical benefit but as outlined above, how much of that comes from Palforzia and how much from native peanut OIT will no doubt vary."
Risankizumab_for_previously_treated_moderately_to_severely_active_Crohn's_disease.pdf,"1. Yes. Risankizumab is innovative in that it is the first agent in its class for IBD. The endoscopic healing data, in particular, is very impressive and could reasonably be expected to provide a significant and substantial health-related benefits. There is such a large unmet need in Crohn’s currently that no clinician would suggest that risankizumab would completely fulfill this need, but one would expect that it would go some way to addressing it."
Selpercatinib_for_untreated_RET_fusion-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. RET-positive lung cancers are better served with targeted therapy from the beginning, rather than having to be treated with initial chemotherapy/immunotherapy/both. We know that the most appropriate treatment for the subset of lung cancer patients with RET fusions (both in terms of tolerability and, in most cases, also efficacy) is targeted therapy, but patients are not able to access this treatment in first-line.

2. Yes this would be a step change in the management of the condition. A targetable approach is likely to be more effective and better tolerated – reducing the potential attrition seen in lines of therapy meaning some patient with RET alterations may not receive a targeted treatment."

Anakinra_for_treating_Still’s_disease.pdf,"1. By using the Anakinra earlier in the patient pathway we have a chance to influence the outcome during a window of opportunity when the disease is predominantly driven by the IL-1 pathway. This has now been demonstrated in a few trials. It has the potential to result in a considerable step change in outcomes and has the potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. The published trials have demonstrated: an earlier remission, less or no steroid use and higher numbers of drug-free survival. Using Anakinra earlier in the treatment pathway would represent a step change in the management of the condition. Using Anakinra earlier in the treatment pathway with its potential to achieve early remission and reduction of disease and steroid morbidity is a significant unmet need in this population."
Upadacitinib_for_treating_moderately_to_severely_active_ulcerative_colitis.pdf,"1. Upadacitinib is a selective Jak1 inhibitor (tofacitinib is non selective) so it has a novel mechanism of action. This selectivity may result in fewer side effects but longer term data required to confirm this. The efficacy data is impressive and therefore has the potential to make a significant and substantial impact on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. Our current treatments are limited by high proportion of non-responders as well as patients losing response and therefore there is an unmet need to have newer treatments that may be more effective.

2. Yes – limited options to treat ulcerative colitis and being an oral agent makes this a significant change in ulcerative colitis management. Once daily dosing vs tofacitinib bd. Upadacitinib was significantly more effective than placebo at treating patients with ulcerative colitis. Yes. As an oral agent this could be used 2nd or 3rd line following conventional therapy. Additional oral option for the management and treatment of ulcerative colitis."
Pembrolizumab_with_axitinib_for_untreated_advanced_renal_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Yes, this combination is already demonstrating substantial improvements in all measured parameters after relatively short follow-up (1yr OS 90% vs 78%, median PFS extended by 4 months, response rate 59% vs 36% and complete response rate 6% vs 2%).

All of the above parameters represent a huge step forwards in the treatment of metastatic RCC compared to using single agent VEGF TKIs such as Sunitinib. The durability of these responses for some patients is completely transformative, and therefore this combination significantly reduces the unmet need for responding patients.

Definitely – as highlighted in the responses above.

2. This technology would be the first of its kind to combine immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGF TKI, which has shown improvement in all clinical relevant end points of progression free survival, overall survival, and overall response rate. This technology offers the option of durable clinical response without the additional side effects and thereby addresses an unmet need for this patient population.

3. The company considers that the innovative immuno-oncology combination regimen of pembrolizumab plus axitinib represents a “step-change” in the management of RCC as it targets both angiogenesis and immune-checkpoint pathways. The CS states that pembrolizumab should be considered innovative by its potential to make a significant and substantial impact in an area of high unmet need. The ERG clinical advisors agree there does remain an element of unmet need and that the rationale for the treatment combination in RCC is made. However, there are other potential treatments that should be considered in relation to pembrolizumab and axitinib, such as avelumab plus axitinib, currently the subject of a separate NICE technology appraisal.

5. The company considers the drug to be innovative. One clinical expert, in support that the intervention was innovative, commented on the proportion of patients that may achieve a durable response without the significant adverse events noticed with ipilimumab or nivolumab. They also stated this technology would be first of its kind to combine immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGF TKI. Another clinical expert supported the notion that the intervention was innovative due to the potential durability of response and improved survival. However, the technical team believes that all relevant benefits associated with the drug are adequately captured in the model and the QALY calculation.

"Abemaciclib_with_an_aromatase_inhibitor_for_previously_untreated,_hormone_receptor-positive,_HER2-negative,_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_breast_cancer.pdf","1. The introduction of the CDK 4/6 inhibitors in addition to AIs in the treatment of hormone-receptor positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is a major advance in treatment of this disease. It has achieved a significant improvement in progression-free survival Hazard ratio 0.54 and median not yet reached, 14.7 months for placebo (Monarch 3), with low toxicity. Additionally, objective response rates are higher and can lead to a greater improvement in symptom control. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are currently being tested in the adjuvant setting after surgery in high-risk early breast cancer. The introduction of CDK 4/6 inhibitors is an important improvement in the care pathway of patients with hormone-receptor positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients with hormone-receptor positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer can have a long survival but for most patients their disease progresses necessitating further treatment, including chemotherapy with more inconvenience to patients and more toxicity for patients. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are generally well tolerated and allow many patients to live without symptoms or treatment toxicity when compared to AIs alone as they are more effective (improved progression-free survival and higher response rates)."
Daratumumab_in_combination_for_untreated_multiple_myeloma_when_a_stem_cell_transplant_is_suitable.pdf,"1. Yes, this is the first in class monoclonal antibody to be licenced in multiple myeloma. Its use in first line treatment induces increased depth and durability of response reducing both morbidity and overall survival in what still remains a generally incurable but increasingly chronic disease.

2. Current induction regimen VTD is unable to induce deep remissions for a proportion of newly diagnosed patients prior to transplant. Addition of Daratumumab is able to increase the proportion of patients who respond and induce deeper responses ( MRD negativity) which is sustained for longer. Induction regimens have incrementally improved outcomes in myeloma over the last 5 years. Addition of Daratumumab is a further improvement to induction regimens prior to autologous stem cell transplant. Enables more patients to go through autologous stem cell transplant."

Dabrafenib_with_trametinib_for_treating_BRAF_V600E_mutation-positive_glioma_in_children_and_young_people_aged_1_year_and_over.pdf,"1. The Phase II trial(s) of dabrafenib and trametinib do indeed represent a step-change in the management of children and young adults with BRAF V600E mutated gliomas, providing significant health benefits compared to current therapies available, and therein meeting the unmet needs highlighted in the answer to question 10 as summarised again below:

Patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive low-grade glioma have sub-optimal responses to conventional chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic approaches, with a consequent inferior progression-free and overall survival, often multiple disease relapse episodes and a cumulative toxicity burden when compared with most other low-grade glioma patients. Such repeated admissions and attendances to hospital have physical and emotional health / wellbeing implications for the patient and their family, alongside the social and financial burdens that ensue. This is mirrored by the significant, repeated resource allocation for health care professionals (bed occupancy, chemotherapy use, supportive care implications, staffing resource etc.).

The Phase II randomised, open-label trial of dabrafenib with trametinib as first-line therapy in BRAF V600E mutated low-grade gliomas (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02684058), reported an overall response rate of 47% for the technology versus 11% for standard first-line chemotherapy. Protracted clinical benefit was higher (86% versus 46%), median progression-free survival was longer (20.1 months versus 7.4 months) and significant organ toxicity was lower (47% versus 94%) with dabrafenib/trametinib when compared to conventional chemotherapy (Bouffet et al, 2023). This, together with further evidence from the Phase II/III study assessing trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in children with lesions harbouring BRAF V600E mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02124772) (Bouffet et al, 2023 JCO), indicates that dabrafenib with trametinib should be considered for both newly diagnosed and progressive, relapsed paediatric BRAF V600E mutated low-grade glioma at any stage of disease, and at any point in a treatment decision pathway.

2. Dabrafenib and Trametinib represent a step-change in the management of BRAFV600E glioma; they have truly revolutionized the order in which we consider treatment options for these diseases."
Maribavir_for_treating_refractory_cytomegalovirus_infection_after_transplant.pdf,"1. Provided Maribavir is proven to be effective in the treatment of patients who have resistant or refractory disease in the context of SOT this could have a significant impact as options are currently limited for this group.

2. Yes innovative as it is an oral agent and its use will reduce inpatient stay. A treatment advance especially for renal transplant cohort. In patients with renal dysfunction avoiding use of a known nephrotoxin is always clinically preferable.

3. Yes – as different mode of action.

Reduction in renal toxicity associated with current second-line therapies.

4. Assuming the results of the SOLSTICE trial are borne out in clinical practice, this could have a significant impact as options are currently limited for this group."

CAR-T therapy is a revolutionary treatment which has produced impressive results in previously untreatable cancers and has the potential to offer cure. It represents a major innovation in cancer immunotherapy and in our ability to treat cancers without resorting to intensive chemotherapy or allogenic stem cell transplants.

2. Patient stay is about 10 days post infusion. This is better than an allograft and there is no gvhd.

It is innovative in the same way tisagenlecleucel was new. May I be blunt? If you relapse post allograft with ALL you die. With tcartus you have a 40-50% chance of being cured. It is a massive step change and meets an unmet need."

The technology is considered a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses a particular unmet need of the patient population by offering an additional therapeutic option for patients who do not tolerate or respond to NSAID, TNF inhibitor, or secukinumab.

2. Yes, the data from axSpA and PsA trials suggest that the efficacy of this drug on skin psoriasis is excellent, and enhanced from other available IL-17i. It offers a second option within the class of TNFi.

3. Yes, it will provide an alternative for people who do not respond to more traditional therapies such as anti-TNFs. Yes, increases the choice of drugs available. There are a group of people who do not respond to anti-TNFs and this group of people will benefit."
Tisagenlecleucel_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_B-cell_acute_lymphoblastic_leukaemia_in_people_25 years_and_under.pdf,"1. There are no alternative effective therapies for patients in second or greater relapse or for those who relapse post stem cell transplantation: Patients in the UK receive blinatumomab for first relapse and re-treatment is not reimbursed on the NHS should they have a second relapse, nor have outcomes been defined for re-treatment. Patients who have had a first transplantation procedure generally do not get offered a second stem cell transplant because of significant procedural mortality of 25-30% and poor efficacy because of high relapse rate leading to an overall survival of 25-40%. Patients who meet eligibility to proceed to stem cell transplant because of poor risk disease and low predicted EFS who have co-morbidity or lack of a suitable donor have no effective alternative therapies. All these groups are benefitted substantially by having access to Kymriah as a potentially curative option. Data supporting improved outcomes compared to standard of care therapy in this context has been discussed in point 10 above.

2. Yes. This ground-breaking new technology has enabled long term cure in 40% of patients who relapse after Stem Cell Transplant and were previously incurable. Likewise for patient with refractory disease and those in 2nd or greater relapse, it offers the potential to avoid the need for Stem Cell transplant with its attendant 10-20% mortality, acute complications including GVHD and late effects."

Obinutuzumab_for_untreated_advanced_follicular_lymphoma.pdf,"1. Gazyvaro is considered an innovative technology with substantial potential impact on health-related benefits through its mechanism as a first-in-class Type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibody. This unique action involves enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, increased direct cell death, and a lower degree of complement-dependent cytotoxicity compared with non-glycoengineered, Type I antibodies such as MabThera and ofatumumab. The GALLIUM trial demonstrates that replacing MabThera with Gazyvaro in the immunotherapy induction and monotherapy maintenance setting for previously untreated FL patients produces a meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). This addresses a significant unmet need for this patient population, potentially leading to a substantial positive impact on patients' lives."
Midostaurin_for_untreated_acute_myeloid_leukaemia.pdf,"1. The NCRI-ACP-RCP Group has considered the relevant evidence concerning the use of midostaurin in AML and accepts the adjustments that the ERG made to Novartis's base-case model as summarized in section 3.16 of the appraisal consultation document, with the possible exception of the decision to increase the maximum number of cycles of maintenance therapy from 12 to 18 (given that only a very limited number of patients in the RATIFY study went on to receive 18 cycles) and that approval is currently being sought for 12 cycles of maintenance therapy. 

The RATIFY study clearly showed that midostaurin with chemotherapy was significantly more clinically-effective than chemotherapy alone in terms of both improved overall survival and event-free survival for patients with FLT3-mutated newly-diagnosed AML. This represents an innovative, potentially available in AML intensive treatment schedules that have not been significantly improved for >30 years."
Benralizumab_for_treating_severe_eosinophilic_asthma.pdf,"1. Yes it is innovative in its particular action on the IL5 receptor although the effect of reducing eosinophils is not. As above it improves the way this is met by giving an alternative to oral corticosteroid therapy. This adds to the options for biologic therapy at this severity of asthma.

2. Major impact over established care but impact over and above mepolizumab less dramatic. IL-5 antagonists are a step-change, but the benefits of benralizumab over mepolizumab/reslizumab cannot really be described as a step-change.

3. Highly innovative in mode of action although efficacy likely to be similar to mepolizumab and reslizumab only in mode of action although mepolizumab as first anti-eosinophil drug was the real step-change and efficacy of benralizumab likely to be similar to mepolizumab / reslizumab.

Yes significant change after no therapy change in 20-30 years

3. Yes. This is the first significant improvement in the systemic management of SCLC since the 1990s. This is despite a number of clinical trials assessing a number of different agents. It is also the 1st time that immunotherapy has been associated with a significant benefit in SCLC. Outcomes with extensive stage SCLC are extremely poor and haven’t improved in recent years. Active SCLC is associated with a heavy symptom burden. This treatment offers a longer period of disease control for some patients.

2. Yes, as this therapy that is based on individual germline genetics assessment and may be influenced by germline genetics results funded by NHS England.

3. Yes, this technology specifically addresses the needs of the metastatic breast cancer subset who carry germline BRCA mutation. The AE profile and QOL date from EMBRACA is extremely reassuring in this regard, clearly demonstrating significant clinical benefit to talazoparib and no increase in toxicity compared to physicians choice chemotherapy. Within this trial only 3.6% of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects supporting good tolerability with this agent."

Venetoclax_with_azacitidine_for_untreated_acute_myeloid_leukaemia_when_intensive_chemotherapy_is_unsuitable.pdf,"1. Venetoclax is a first in class agent for its use in AML and is innovative in both mechanism and synergy with existing agents. Both phase 1b/II and Phase 3 published trial data support that this technology is a major step change in how we manage AML. Importantly the administration of these agents can be given largely on an outpatient basis (with the exception of the induction phase) thereby minimizing hospitalisation days and overall toxicity profiles are favorable permitting delivery to this group of patients who otherwise have extremely limited options and a dismal outlook.

Yes. The mechanism of action and the toxicity profile are very different to our currently available therapies. This therefore permits administration to life-prolonging treatments to patients who would otherwise have very limited options. The response profile also includes subgroups of patients whose disease would generally respond poorly to LD-AraC or intensive chemotherapies.

Yes. The active treatment option for most of these patients is so limited in its efficacy that BSC is often the only thing appropriate to offer these patients. This is particularly true of high-risk disease with complex karyotype or p53 mutations who do not respond to single agent LD AraC. Therefore there has long been a significant unmet need for active therapies suitable for this patient group which this TA delivers.

The main difference in side effects of the TA is the increased incidence of febrile neutropenia. Treatment of febrile neutropenia requires admission to hospital for management. As our experience with the technology increases we expect to more aggressively and pre-emptively manage neutropenia. Nonetheless, such events are offset by a reduction in the number of hospital visits for transfusions which are both labor and time intensive for patients.

2. Yes. This is the first combined non-intensive therapy which has improved OS for older AML patients. Many agents have been evaluated without success. We finally have a new standard of care. As the new standard of care all subsequent evaluations/clinical trials will be evaluated against Venetoclax-AZA. AML Studies in development are building on this platform.

It will improve the care for patients with this condition. Extend therapeutic options for patients who do not tolerate or respond to NSAID and TNF inhibitors.

2. The technology is innovative as it’s the first anti IL-17 technology for the use in non radiographic axial SpA patients. These patients have had access to TNF inhibitors only. I have outlined the lack of response to TNF inhibitors in previous questions and this technology provides an alternative treatment for them. Yes – as it’s the first anti IL17 therapy for this patient group. There are patients who are unable to have anti TNF therapies – those with multiple sclerosis/ family history of multiple sclerosis/ interstitial lung disease. The data for this technology with regard to psoriasis improvement is superior to that seen with TNF inhibitor therapies.

3. Yes, treatment will be started earlier in the disease pathway and disease control will be better, resulting in more positive impacts on health-related benefits and improvements in managing the current need. The technology is considered a 'step-change' in the management of the condition, providing earlier diagnosis which therefore will improve patient well-being."

Although it is not expected to have a substantial impact for the whole relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis population, it may provide significant health-related benefits to patients who have poor gastrointestinal tolerability of dimethyl fumarate. It will help meet the unmet need to have additional options for oral first-line therapies with improved tolerability. It addresses the need of patients who have been unable to tolerate dimethyl fumarate due to gastrointestinal side-effects to continue treatment with an oral first-line drug with equivalent efficacy to dimethyl fumarate. It also helps address the wider need to have increased options for oral first-line therapies with improved tolerability."
Teclistamab_for_treating_relapsed_and_refractory_multiple_myeloma_after_3_or_more_treatments.pdf,"1. The technology, teclistamab, introduces a novel class of MM treatments. It is a first-in-class T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, representing the first new class of treatment since the introduction of anti-CD38 mAbs over 5 years ago. The innovative mechanism of action demonstrated by teclistamab monotherapy could represent a significant step-change in managing relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients. This technology is seen as providing deep and durable responses and offers long-term survival possibilities in patients nearing the end of their terminal illness, providing a significant psychological and practical benefit.

Moreover, the significance of innovative technologies like teclistamab lies in their ability to provide hope and treatment options for patients who are at the end of available therapies, addressing an important unmet need. The technology is noted for offering the potential for future benefits as medical advancements continue, suggesting that patients responding to such treatments could derive further benefits as new treatments become available, although these potential future benefits are not included in current economic models or analyses.

2. The response to the question concerning the innovation and potential impact of the technology on health-related benefits is explained through the introduction of the treatment called teclistamab. Teclistamab, being a BCMA targeted T-cell engager, offers a novel approach within the treatment pathway for multiple myeloma. It is particularly beneficial for refractory patients who have experienced incomplete responses or lengthy remissions previously, providing them a chance to achieve better health outcomes. The response rates for teclistamab are comparatively high and impact significantly on patients' lives, affecting daily livings such as mood swings, aggression, mania, insomnia, and fatigue. Additionally, teclistamab extends the potential benefits to the patients by enabling future treatment innovations to be effective, considering that patients responding to teclistamab might live long enough to benefit from subsequent innovative therapies emerging in the field.

3. Yes, teclistamab will be the first bispecific T-cell engager therapy available for myeloma patients in the UK as standard of care. For many patients with myeloma, there is now only the option of pomalidomide/dexamethasone after 3 lines of treatment as they will be refractory to a CD38 monoclonal antibody and have received bortezomib/vorinostat/dexamethasone and lenalidomide already. Pomalidomide/dexamethasone is less efficacious that teclistamab (in terms of progression-free survival) and can be less ideal for patients with cytopenias, pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (often from other myeloma-directed therapies) or those whom would not be suitable to receive thromboprophylaxis.

4. ""This is a new technology in myeloma, targeting BCMA using a bispecific antibody. The results reported in a single arm Phase 1-2 Majestec-1 study is very encouraging. Yes, new target (BCMA) and a new technology bispecific antibody with significant uplift in response rates. The currently available drugs induce a response only in a third of patients. This new technology in a randomised study show up to 63% response with meaningful improvement in overall survival. Therefore this provides a significant uplift in response rates which deals with the significant unmet need in this patient population.""

5. Teclistamab is a bispecific antibody and represents a major advance in myeloma treatment. These demonstrate remarkable activity in patients that have stopped responding to standard treatments and are a ""step-change"" in treatments. The treatment has demonstrated high activity in those that have been exposed to the main 3 classes of treatment (proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent and CD38 antibody). The prognosis of such patients is otherwise poor.

6. The images provided do not contain the response to the question 'Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?'

Risankizumab_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_plaque_psoriasis.pdf,"1. Targeting the IL-23 pathway is a new treatment approach for psoriasis and mAb directed against the IL-23 p19 subunit (including tildrakizumab) appear to be highly effective, particularly with respect to achieving disease clearance. The dosing schedule of risankizumab (and tildrakizumab, i.e., every 12 weeks) maybe helpful or in fact preferred by some individuals (cf. to guselkumab).

2. This is the first reported trial in over 10 years that has shown a statistically significantly improved overall survival over standard of care cisplatin/gemcitabine, and so is a step change for these patients, improving overall survival to over 1 year, with patients thus potentially living long enough to receive more novel therapies in a clinical trial or agents in development."
Lenalidomide_with_rituximab_for_previously_treated_follicular_lymphoma.pdf,"1. Yes. The prolongation in survival observed over the last few decades is likely to reflect the incremental availability of new treatments that can be effective when previous ones have failed. Lenalidomide plus rituximab constitutes such a new treatment option.

2. This innovative new technology could meet the unmet needs of a) high risk chemo and/or rituximab refractory patients experiencing an early first relapse, b) heavily pre-treated multiply relapsed patients who have either become chemo-refractory or exhausted standard options and c) patients who are not fit for standard chemotherapy due to its potential toxicity. The new technology has a unique mode of action that is well tolerated and proven to overcome rituximab resistance. If employed, the new technology could make a substantial improvement to duration and quality of life for these patient groups.

Dapagliflozin joins a number of other SGLT2i's in demonstrating significant outcome benefits in patients with heart failure, but there has been no prior evidence for HFpEF. Therefore, whilst the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure may not be innovative, this new indication of HFpEF is. It maintains potential to provide significant health benefits in patients with HFpEF by creating a therapeutic option and may improve access to HF specialists. The DELIVER study shows significant benefits of SGLT2i's in patients with HFpEF and the SGLT2i class represents a new and the only prognostic treatment for HFpEF.

2. Yes. Until now all no evidence-based therapy has been available for HFpEF/HFmrEF patients. The therapy addresses the major unmet needs of reducing hospital admissions and improving quality of life.

3. Yes this a step change in management. The first medication to show a meaningful difference in clinical outcomes for HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF have a significant unmet need in terms of treatments to improve symptoms, quality of life and reduce deterioration. The SGLT2i go someway towards this."

Venetoclax_with_rituximab_for_previously_treated_chronic_lymphocytic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Yes, because all the upcoming data suggests that treatment duration could be defined by the achievement of MRD negativity with combination therapy. This trial was not MRD driven trial but the concept is being used in multiple upcoming front line and relapsed trials.

2. Yes. This group of patients with Relapsed/Refractory CLL is generally considered to be at the “end of Life” and therefore the impact of high remission rates and prolonged survival is a substantial shift in prognosis compared with either supportive care or Chemolmmunotherapy such as Bendamustine and Rituximab. Patients on supportive care have a poor prognosis and require frequent or prolonged remissions for management of palliative care needs such as infections or transfusion requirement. Alternative chemolmmunotherapy is unsuitable in most cases in an elderly population or those with 17p or TP53 mutation. Chemolmmunotherapy (e.g., Bendamustine Rituximab) is associated with a higher risk of febrile neutropoenia, lower overall response rates and shorter Progression free survival.

3. There will be major benefits for the QALY due to the fixed duration of therapy compared to the standard of care at present. In addition patients tend to tolerate venetoclax well which will improve their compliance and outcome. Yes the combination of venetoclax plus rituximab is innovative in that it leads to a high proportion of patients achieving the best possible remissions (the eradication of minimal residual disease) and is the first targeted therapy for CLL with a fixed duration of treatment. Yes due to the fixed duration of therapy and eradication of MRD."

2. NA

3. Yes, the technology is considered to be a step-change in the management of the condition. It addresses a particular unmet need of the patient population, as this group of patients who are cisplatin-ineligible had poor median survival documented in clinical trials. This had not changed until the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The clinical trials data and the real world data are extremely encouraging and hopefully our patients will continue to benefit based on the data showing significant survival benefit and excellent tolerability."

Avelumab_with_axitinib_for_untreated_advanced_renal_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Avelumab plus axitinib is one of the first combinations of immunotherapy plus VEGFR inhibitor. Currently, UK cancer survival rates trail about 10 years behind other comparable European countries, including Italy and Austria. If the UK is to improve patient outcomes, including the patient experience as well as overall survival, it is vital that these novel combinations are made available to patients in order that they have the best possible care. If these combinations are not made available, it leaves UK patients at a major disadvantage in terms of the availability of innovative cancer treatments; these patients are likely to die prematurely compared to other kidney cancer patients in the rest of Europe and North America. Poor UK survival rates might possibly be due to the restrictions in clinical choice brought about by UK regulatory authorities. In the absence of biomarkers for the treatment of RCC, clinicians are not able to predict which patients will respond to which drug, and drug selection is accomplished by trial and error. Clinicians should have the ability to choose the most effective treatments for individual patients from those available, and without the avelumab plus axitinib combination, the clinician's choice of treatment is seriously compromised. Without treatment alternatives in the first-line, most patients will face disease progression. A choice of treatment is paramount for the effective management of the progression of this disease and maintenance of quality of life. Current first-line treatment options are not effective for everyone. Undue restrictions in accessing novel combination therapies would simply add unnecessary additional burden to patients with a terminal diagnosis. Having more choice in the first-line setting would enable patients and oncologists to individualise treatment plans according to specific disease/treatment history and contraindications, thereby enabling the best possible quality of life for the patient.

2. This is the first immunotherapy/TKI combination. Good prognosis RCC patients currently do not receive immunotherapy as a first line treatment. This would be an improvement."
Brentuximab_vedotin_in_combination_for_untreated_systemic_anaplastic_large_cell_lymphoma.pdf,"1. Yes, this is a paradigm shift in management for (Alk positive and Alk negative) ALCL. See above comments - first RCT to demonstrate significant PFS and OS advantaged in TNHL. In this case, the benefits were absolutely clear and practice-changing in the ~70% of patients in the ECHELON2 study who had ALCL. Additionally, it addresses the unmet need of relapse and death from disease.

2. Yes, this immunotherapeutic approach is innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits. This technology provides a huge step-change in the management of this condition. A+CHP results in prolonged PFS and OS. Yes – improvement in PFS/OS. There has been no prior randomised trial that has shown superiority for CHOP as 1st line treatment but the results from this treatment approach (CHOP) have been disappointing for this indication.

3. Yes, the evidence in ALCL is practice changing and will cure more patients with ALCL and improve the disease-free survival for others with comparable morbidity to CHOP. This is the first clinically important improvement in outcome over CHOP chemotherapy in a group of patients who are usually symptomatic, relapse early (usually within 12 months) and have poor survival outcomes. Yes, improvement in survival outcomes and cure for patients with ALCL."
Lorlatinib_for_previously_treated_ALK-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1.

"Quizartinib_for_induction,_consolidation_and_maintenance_treatment_of_newly_diagnosed_FLT3-ITD-positive_acute_myeloid_leukaemia.pdf","1. Given the absence of a direct comparison between the new technology (drug) and current care, it is challenging to determine whether the new technology represents an improvement on existing care. The addition of quizartinib to chemotherapy does, however, provide an alternative option for patients with AML characterized by FLT3-ITD who may be intolerant to current care with midostaurin (until transplantation) or maintenance/continuation therapy with azacitidine (in non-transplant candidates) or sorafenib (in the post-transplant setting).

2. Reducing the risk of relapse is a significant improvement for patients, psychologically and a substantial health-related benefit.
There are no other additional factors affecting QALY.

This technology is a step change as it uses a significantly more potent, second-generation Flt3 inhibitor, across a much larger age range and uniformly through all stages of treatment ie induction, consolidation and maintenance in transplanted and non-transplanted patients.

3. Without any prospective / direct clinical trial comparison to current standard of care it is really not possible for me to conclude that this new technology represents a 'step change' in management of AML as we simply don’t know whether it is better to combine 1st or 2nd generation TKIs with intensive chemotherapy. The results of RATIFY and QUANTUM-First are broadly similar.

If quizartinib were to be approved for IC-fit patients >60yrs, then it would represent a potential advance for those patients (although they currently able to access midostaurin as NICE approval of midostaurin is ‘age agnostic’)."

Pembrolizumab_for_treating_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_urothelial_carcinoma_after_platinum-containing_chemotherapy.pdf,"1. Bladder Cancer has had relatively little research and new treatment development in recent decades. Despite it being one of the 10 most prevalent cancers, and very expensive for the NHS to treat, mortality rates of c50% have shown NO improvement in the past 30 years. The mechanism of this new drug is different from anything available to treat BC today, hence the treatment is highly innovative. ABC UK supports the licencing and use of the treatment within the NHS. Ideally more research could be commissioned to optimise the treatment regimen and to better understand the mechanism of treatment, ultimately leading to biomarkers to identify patients for whom the treatment would be effective/ineffective.
The treatment is highly innovative. 
The treatment gives hope to many for whom other treatment options have been exhausted.
Further research/trials to optimise the treatment and develop biomarkers would be highly desirable.
Consideration should be given for research/trails for use of the treatment earlier in the disease progress and/or as a primary treatment.

2. Yes in the sense that we had been using chemotherapy for a few decades with no new options for treatment or improvement in outcomes and KEYNOTE-045 introduced the use of an entirely different therapeutic approach with pembrolizumab. As described above, outcomes are poor and pembrolizumab extends survival with less toxicity from treatment."
Dinutuximab_beta_for_treating_neuroblastoma.pdf,"1. The technology introduces a new treatment modality into a multi-modality treatment regime. A randomised trial of a similar (but different) technology – dinutuximab, has shown significant improvement in 2 year EFS and OS in those receiving dinutuximab (in conjunction with cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF), compared to those treated with cis-retinoic acid alone (Yu et al., NEJM 2010). Data presented at SIOP 2017 conference (Washington) compared results (EFS and OS) of patients treated with dinutuximab beta on the SIOPEN HR-NBL-1 trial with those treated with dinutuximab in the NEJM paper. The outcomes are shown to be comparable, suggesting that efficacy of dinutuximab and dinutuximab beta may be similar.

This trial comparison cannot substitute a direct randomised trial of dinutuximab beta vs control, but it would no longer be acceptable to professionals, parents and families to perform the ideal randomised trial of dinutuximab beta vs no immunotherapy treatment, because of these data and adoption of immunotherapy as standard treatment in high risk neuroblastoma in Europe and the USA.

2. The technology has resulted in a step change in the outcome of children with high risk neuroblastoma. Yes, the technology is a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses a particular unmet need of the patient population."

Yes – as outlined above."
Ponesimod_for_treating_relapsing–remitting_multiple_sclerosis.pdf,"1. The technology is similar in its mechanism of action (sphingosine receptor antagonism) to another currently available DMT (fingolimod) although as a more selective drug (antagonising type 1 receptors only) may have an improved cardiac side effect profile which could allow reduced cardiac monitoring at treatment initiation compared with fingolimod. In addition, the technology has a significantly shorter half-life than fingolimod which allows for quicker wash-out if complications/side effects arise which may be an advantage by shortening time for lymphocyte recovery after treatment discontinuation. It offers further choice to the patient with active RR MS which is more efficacious than one of the other already approved DMTs in this group of first line therapies (Teriflunomide) and a further option to some people with highly active RR MS where fingolimod is currently positioned.

2. A further treatment resource to add to the current treatments available.

3. It is another SIP inhibitor drug. There may be particular advantages and a broader spectrum of eligible patients. Improve the way that current need is met? No; Not significantly.

4. No; but represents a refinement of an existing drug class and short washout which will be useful in patients considering families etc. Yes if approved for first line treatment in active disease; Yes; early more effective oral DMT."
Bevacizumab_gamma_for_treating_wet_age-related_macular_degeneration.pdf,"1. Yes.

2. It will mean we have an option of a licensed version of bevacizumab. Some clinicians and hospitals have concerns regarding using off label bevacizumab but I do not think it will materially change the health-related benefits of current care and may decrease it due to increasing treatment due to a shorter interval between treatments. It may however make treatment cheaper for drug cost but this may be offset by more frequent injections and hospital visits. Furthermore the advent of biosimilar forms of both ranibizumab and aflibercept will mean that the potential cost savings from the use of bevacizumab will be reduced."
Avelumab_for_treating_metastatic_Merkel_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Yes, it is innovative — the ability of the pharmaceutical company to get phase 2 data is to be commended. This is a difficult tumour site to either set up a trial, achieve data & identify a drug that is effective. As indicated the drug is less toxic than standard and maintains patients well being to allow them to continue the 'rest of their life'. Definitely — this has the potential to allow a minority of patients to achieve reasonable outcomes (rather than the standard poor ones). Yes — this is a rare tumour type in which no specific good data has been seen until now. This opens the door to allow better management of their cancer.

2. Yes; lower toxicity than chemotherapy, safer to use and likely to produce longer lasting responses in a subset of patients. Yes."
Arsenic_trioxide_for_treating_acute_promyelocytic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. Yes I do. For APL patients this is completely transforming technology

2. Yes. For APL patients, this is completely transforming technology. The use of up-front ATO (with ATRA) has transformed this hyper-acute, once rapidly fatal disease into the most highly curable acute leukemia in adults without the requirement for administering chemotherapy. First-line therapy with ATO is associated with a very low risk of relapse in APL. This compares with current chemotherapy where the relapse risk is at least 20%. ATO is also suitable for patients who have secondary APL due to previous chemotherapy exposure or older frail patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. At present, in order to gain access to ATO, an independent funding request demonstrating exceptionality needs to be completed for each individual patient placing a considerable administrative burden on physicians and delaying access to treatment in what is essentially an emergency situation.

3. Yes I do. For APL patients this is completely transforming technology. The use of upfront ATO (with ATRA) has transformed this hyper-acute, once rapidly fatal disease into the most highly curable acute leukaemia in adults without the requirement for administering chemotherapy. It is the opinion of the NCRI AML Working Group that ATO is the treatment of choice for standard risk APL patients at diagnosis and for high risk patients who have relapsed after initial treatment with AIDA chemotherapy. Yes. First line therapy with ATO is associated with a very low risk of relapse in APL. This compares with current chemotherapy where the relapse risk is at least 20%. ATO is also suitable for patients who have secondary APL due to previous chemotherapy exposure or older frail patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. At present, in order to gain access to ATO, an independent funding request demonstrating exceptionality needs to be completed for each individual patient placing a considerable administrative burden on physicians and delaying access to treatment in what is essentially an emergency situation."
Tenecteplase_for_treating_acute_ischaemic_stroke.pdf,"1. Current need will be met but very much more quickly. The new treatment is a step in the right direction more than a step change.

2. Yes. Easier transfers, this will release nurses to look after other patients. Use of multiple ambulance transfers (i.e., into hospital and then later to the neuroscience centre) is likely to be more streamlined in such cases in addition. There are a limited number of interventional neuroradiologists to perform mechanical thrombectomy. These operators must be concentrated in a small number of specialist centers. Anything which speeds up this necessary 'drip and ship' model would be of great benefit.

3. Tenecteplase is a single bolus thrombolytic agent with higher fibrin specificity and longer half-life than alteplase. Tenecteplase can be infused over 5 seconds versus alteplase which is infused over 60 minutes. Bolus delivery enables rapid clot exposure to high enzyme concentrations facilitating rapid fibrinolysis thereby achieving earlier vessel recanalization and reperfusion. Tenecteplase has clear practical work-flow advantages over alteplase given its relative ease of preparation and administration. This translated into objective improvements in treatment times in three different non-randomized, real-world clinical studies. A 40-min improvement in time from presentation to thrombectomy in transfer patients treated at an outside hospital was noted in one study after the transition to tenecteplase. This would have a significant impact on patient outcomes as for every 4-min delay from presentation to reperfusion, 1 of every 100 patients has a worse disability outcome (mRS increase by 1 or more). Incremental change."

Brolucizumab_for_treating_diabetic_macular_oedema.pdf,"1. It may provide a meaningful impact on patients who are not responsive to current care. As a first line treatment and comparing with currently available treatment/current care, the impact is unlikely to be different. It provides an alternative effective treatment option for the condition and potentially benefiting patients who are currently not experiencing optimal response with the current care.

2. Yes, the technology is innovative, and represents a step-change in DMO management.

The particular unmet need is longer duration of drying effect: less frequent injections, and better reduction in the macular oedema, and improved visual acuity.

The RCOphth guidance on Management of Ophthalmology Services during the COVID pandemic recommends that treatment changes that can reduce the frequency of required attendances for the next few months e.g. changes in intravitreal treatment regime or longer-acting drug or procedure that would result in a lower number of hospital visits (RCOphth 2020, COVID-19 Clinical Guidance and National Information. RCOphth Management of Ophthalmology Services during the Covid pandemic dated 28th March 2020).
-During this unprecedented time of COVID-19, there is a stronger need for a therapy in phakic DMO with a predictable, extended treatment duration that would result in fewer hospital visits versus Anti-VEGF thus minimizing the risk of exposure to COVID for both the patients and healthcare worker.
-Diabetes is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality. A nationwide analysis in England demonstrated that a ⅓ of all in-hospital deaths with COVID-19 in England occurred in people with diabetes (Barron E et al. Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2020; 8:813-822)."
Budesonide_orodispersible_tablet_for_inducing_remission_of_eosinophilic_oesophagitis.pdf,"1. Yes. The technology is a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses an unmet need as there are no other licensed products for EoE available.

2. Yes. Topical corticosteroids are undoubtedly effective, but their use is limited by the lack of a licensed dose of product with an adequate delivery mechanism. This technology is innovative in standardising dose and improving delivery mechanism.

3. Yes, including reduction in hospital admissions with food bolus obstruction. Yes, I think it is, because the vast majority who are treated at present are with swallowed inhaled steroid preparations—and as there is such variation in drug delivery we are porbably undertreating a large population, the effect of which may not be seen until many years later when the have end organ damage. Yes, as currently there is no licensed treatment."
Evinacumab_for_treating_homozygous_familial_hypercholesterolaemia_in_people_12_years_and_over.pdf,"1. Definitely. It gives a third tool to be employed in lowering LDL in these very high risk patients, particularly where apheresis +/- Lomitapide have not been sufficient at bringing LDL-c to target.

2. This technology is a step change and has huge prospect to improve the lives of our patients. We have several patients who can tolerate neither apheresis nor lomitapide. These patients now have another option."
Pegcetacoplan_for_treating_paroxysmal_nocturnal_haemoglobinuria.pdf,1. It is innovative and will make a significant and positive impact on patients.

Ixazomib_with_lenalidomide_and_dexamethasone_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_multiple_myeloma.pdf,"1. Yes, because its utility is not restricted by functionality (frail patients tolerate this therapy as well as Unfit and Fit patients alike) or genetic high risk (patients with standard risk and high risk disease respond equally well). This gives true equity of access and responsiveness across the myeloma patient population, which is well known for its patients and disease heterogeneity.

2. The importance of an all-oral regime to patients is unlikely to be captured in a QALY calculation and the massive uptake of this regime during the COVID-19 pandemic speaks to the fact that this regime reduces time in hospital and on chemotherapy day units and greatly reduces the risk of nosocomial infection and patient anxiety around the pandemic. Whilst all patients benefit from the technology it is unusual for patients with high-risk cytogenetics to do as well as patients with standard risk cytogenetics. Patients with high-risk disease would be particularly disadvantaged if the technology was not available."

Technology: the advent of oral treatments for PNH increases options for patients, to have a treatment that fits their preference and lifestyle. Iptacopan is the first oral treatment and thus is a significant step change to disease management.

Unmet needs: Iptacopan is a proximal complement inhibitor, and thus addresses both intravascular haemolysis, and prevents extravascular haemolysis. Haemoglobin increases to near normal/normal enables patients to improve their quality of life and productivity.
There are currently over 12 - 20 patients within a managed access programme to address needs not met by current available treatments.

As it is oral, patients with poor venous access and needle aversion are also treated. For patients with limited hand dexterity, pegcetacoplan is also challenging to administer."
Carfilzomib_with_dexamethasone_and_lenalidomide_for_previously_treated_multiple_myeloma.pdf,"1. Yes particularly for high risk Myeloma patients. Combination therapy for High risk MM patients in first relapse addresses the particular unmet need of the patient population.

Ibrutinib is considered innovative because it is a first-in-class compound targeting Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). This treatment has shown high efficacy in treating CLL with durable remissions and a very low toxicity profile. It is effective in difficult-to-treat groups who are less likely to respond to conventional chemotherapy, including those with 17p-/TP53 deletion/mutation."
Cabozantinib_for_treating_medullary_thyroid_cancer.pdf,"1. The technology described, vandetanib, is noted for its potential beneficial impact on health-related qualities, especially in providing a treatment option for a rare, aggressive, and symptomatically burdensome disease with limited treatment options. Vandetanib offers an innovative approach as it serves a small, distinct patient group that suffers from a chronic and severely disabling condition, medullary thyroid cancer. It aligns with important health technology assessment criteria such as expectancy of life use, and economic considerations like cost-effectiveness. Despite its high acquisition cost, the treatment may extend life, improve quality of life, and provide stability in health expenditures anticipated over a five-year period."
Cemiplimab_for_treating_advanced_cutaneous_squamous_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Yes, it is innovative in that no other treatments are available for advanced cSCC. However, it is not a new treatment as has been in use through the cancer drugs fund for the past 2 years. Yes, we believe so. Yes – complete response or even just control of local progression is an extraordinary advance on any previous therapies.

2. Yes, as above I think that cemiplimab has changed the treatment paradigm for cSCC. We now have a treatment that provides effective tumor control for a significant proportion of our patients with minimal toxicity. Previously the best we could offer most of our patients was best supportive care. In practice this meant discharging patients to the care of their GP/hospice for terminal care. There is an almost complete lack of data on survival of patients with advance, metastatic sSCC. There are a number of reasons for this, but partly it is because the lack of treatment options meant that these patients were not followed up in the hospital setting and so accurate data is not there to collect. Cemiplimab now gives us a well-tolerated, effective treatment that improves survival and quality of life for these patients."
Pembrolizumab_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_classical_Hodgkin_lymphoma_in_people_3_years_and_over.pdf,"1. No.

2. Compared to combination chemotherapy pembrolizumab can be given less frequently (every six weeks) as a single infusion, reducing the number of hospital attendances and associated monitoring tests. Outside of the availability of pembrolizumab via the CDF there is no current standard of care, so this drug meets a need for the population under consideration. As immunotherapy pembrolizumab represents an alternative approach to cHL treatment when compared to combination chemotherapy and so at the time of its introduction could certainly have been regarded as a step-change in treatment.

3. Yes- it is definitely a 'step-change’ in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a completely different mechanism of action to other established therapies in this condition. PD-1 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies and are approved across a wide range of indications. Single-agent response rates to PD-1 inhibitors are higher in Hodgkin lymphoma than in any other cancer. These responses are seen even in heavily pre-treated patients who have failed multiple standard therapies. There is increasing recognition of the curative potential of SCT after PD-1 inhibition (see Q22)."
Inclisiran_for_treating_primary_hypercholesterolaemia_or_mixed_dyslipidaemia.pdf,"1. Yes. The major therapeutic advances in this area have been the statins in 1988, PCSK9 monoclonals in 2016, and now this one in 2021. I think however this is a 'game changer' in that it will allow a far wider and greater reduction in LDL levels than ever before with far more certainty that the drug is in the patient.. Yes in that we currently do not the treatment modalities to adequately lower LDL cholesterol in a substantial number of patients at high risk of future ASCVD events.

No similar PFS and response rate results in this setting have been seen previously in HER2+ve tumours. The Destiny O3 data show that trastuzumab deruxtecan could lead to a prolonged period when the patient’s disease is controlled with patients remaining well and able to participate in family, work, and social activities. Accessing trastuzumab deruxtecan may provide reassurance to patients that they are receiving the optimum treatment for their condition, and this can have psychological benefits.

Ceritinib_for_previously_treated_anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase_positive_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Considering a pooled median OS of 15.64 months reported across the ASCEND-2 and ASCEND-1 trials, these results suggest an extension to overall survival of approximately 10 months, well above the 3 month requirement for the end of life criteria. Furthermore, even if the OS of the entire cohort considered in the Ou et al. study is considered, 8.9 months, the extension to overall survival would still be approximately 6 months, again much greater than the 3 month limit specified by the end of life criteria. Although we acknowledge the caveats that must be associated with such naïve comparisons, in the face of the limitations imposed by the available data the only reasonable method to explore uncertainty is to compare certain against this available data. Such a comparison suggests that even if BSC was associated with the treatment benefit in terms of extension to life that resulted from use of chemotherapy in this study (a conservative assumption), certinib offers an extension to life over BSC of well above 3 months."
Empagliflozin_for_treating_chronic_kidney_disease.pdf,"1. No. The SGLT-2 inhibitor class of medication has produced a step-change in the management of CKD, with recent evidence supporting the use of empagliflozin in an expanded group of patients including those with eGFR as low as 20mL/min/1.73m²."
Brigatinib_for_treating_ALK-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_after_crizotinib.pdf,"1. Yes, innovative in so far as it seems markedly more efficacious (cross trial comparisons) to ceritinib with much less toxicities and hence improved dose-intensity. There is currently a need for an efficacious non-toxic next-generation ALK inhibitor for patients progressing on crizotinib. Currently ceritinib is NICE approved for this indication (TA395). However, whilst effective, ceritinib is limited by marked toxicities (e.g. gastrointestinal) and dose reductions are frequent. This may impact on efficacy outcomes. There is therefore a need for an effective tolerable ALK inhibitor post crizotinib. Alectinib is licensed for this indication but unavailable in the UK (TA438). Hence, brigatinib would be a favoured suitable alternative to ceritinib.

2. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?
Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population?

3. Yes:
- substantially improved efficacy in the brain with duration of intracranial response not yet reached in ALTA
- broader mutational coverage and therefore potential suppression of resistant clones (including the G1202R mutation)"

Obinutuzumab_with_bendamustine_for_treating_follicular_lymphoma_after_rituximab.pdf,"1. This is a glycoengineed anti-CD20 antibody and as such is innovative in my view. An improvement in progression free survival, time to next treatment and overall survival represents a significant health-related benefit for this group of patients. It is an important advance due to the reported overall survival benefit in addition to the PFS and TNTT benefit."
Peginterferon_beta-1a_for_treating_relapsing–remitting_multiple_sclerosis.pdf,"1. Peginterferon beta-1a offers the security of an established treatment combined with a less frequent (fortnightly) dosing regimen. At least comparable efficacy at reducing relapse rates compared to current beta interferon drugs. Consequent avoidance of residual disability. Established drug with well-known risk/benefit profile. Less frequent injection frequency compared to presently available beta interferon drugs which enables people to better plan their injections around work and other commitments. Improved quality of life, reduced steroid administration and fewer hospital admissions (resulting from lower relapse rate).

2. Yes. The additional pegylation of the beta-interferon molecule allows for less frequent injections and a significantly lower rate of neutralising antibody formation which may improve compliance, tolerance and potentially some possible improvement in efficacy. It offers a possibly improved method of delivery of a pre-existing molecule."

"Nintedanib_for_previously_treated_locally_advanced,_metastatic,_or_locally_recurrent_non‑small‑cell_lung_cancer.pdf","1. Over the previous decade, no phase III study with any combination of agents has demonstrated an OS benefit versus an active comparator in second-line stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma histology. Thus, there is a high unmet need to improve the treatment options for these patients, in the second-line setting. It has been postulated that an effective strategy for this class of drugs may be the use of an agent targeting more than one angiogenic pathway, in combination with chemotherapy. Moreover, anti-angiogenic agents may be particularly effective in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, which has been characterised as having higher levels of microvessel density compared to other NSCLC histological subtypes.

As a unique, oral triple angiokinase inhibitor simultaneously acting on three receptor classes that have a role in angiogenesis (VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR), nintedanib has the potential to offer important clinical benefits across a broad range of cancers. In the UK, nintedanib fits into the care pathway as an add-on therapy to docetaxel for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology, who have progressed after one prior line of chemotherapy. Docetaxel is currently recommended by NICE Clinical Guideline 121 as a second-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in whom relapse has occurred after previous chemotherapy. However, there is no NICE recommended add-on therapy to second-line docetaxel. Erlotinib is recommended, within its licenced indication, as an alternative to second-line docetaxel treatment only on the basis that it is provided by the manufacturer at an overall treatment cost (including administration, AEs and monitoring costs) equal to that of docetaxel.

Nintedanib, in addition to docetaxel, would provide an alternative treatment option for adenocarcinoma patients in the second-line. This treatment combination would be the first treatment to demonstrate a significant and clinically meaningful OS benefit for second-line adenocarcinoma patients versus an active agent in a phase III clinical trial."

Fluocinolone_acetonide_intravitreal_implant_for_treating_recurrent_non-infectious_uveitis.pdf,"1. The technology’s innovative device enables a small, continuous dosage of the widely-used corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to be released directly into the eye over a period of up to three years. This represents a ‘step change’ in treatment for non-infectious posterior uveitis.

The technology has a long duration of action: around six times longer than a similar corticosteroid intravitreal implant currently available in the UK.

Use of the technology would reduce the number of patient attendances at clinic and would eliminate the hazards of having repeated injections into the eye.

The technology’s device provides controlled release of medication to give smooth compliance with treatment without the patient having to remember to take oral medication.

2. Yes – No other treatment available for uveitis offers the promise of up to 3 years of disease control with a single application and no systemic side effects.

3. Yes. Improved patient satisfaction with regards to fewer hospital visits, less time off work, reduce burden on cares, fewer injection procedures itself. Yes (In the clinically indicated patient group) Yes. Longer duration of disease control with less relapses until the effect of the medication lasts. Treatment option in patients who cannot tolerate/ contraindication of systemic treatment. Treatment option in patients who do not respond to conventional treatment."

Encorafenib_plus_cetuximab_for_previously_treated_BRAF_V600E_mutation-positive_metastatic_colorectal_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes, as described above. Yes, definitely, the first step change ever really in this disease – in terms of something that’s easily administered and tolerated. There are some other small subgroups identified in more toxic four drug regimens but these would be less relevant to the general population of BRAF patients. Yes, this sub group of patients have the poorest survival of all colon cancer patients.

2. Yes as stated above. Innovative drug treatment exploiting specific biology of a sub-group of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (1 in 10), chemotherapy-free, effective, well tolerated treatment as compared to the current chemotherapy based option with associated logistical considerations (including central venous access devices), side effects (fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, myelosuppression, hair loss) and supportive medications which include steroids. I firmly believe that it is. Yes – an effective treatment specifically targeted to the BRAF V600E mutated colorectal cancer – a sub-group of colorectal cancer with a worse outlook and previously no individualised treatment approach.

3. Yes – as no conventional cytotoxic untargeted chemotherapy is needed and one is targeting the causative BRAFV600E mutation pathway directly and its feedback loop in a very specific way. This is the aspiration of all oncology drug development currently."
Pertuzumab_for_the_neoadjuvant_treatment_of_HER2-positive_breast_cancer.pdf,"1. ""The committee concluded that there was considerable uncertainty about whether pathological complete response was a meaningful indicator of long-term survival outcomes, such that it could be viewed as a surrogate marker of long-term benefit.""

""While we agree that no standard relationship is proven between a complete response rate and overall survival, we believe that this presents a problem for this type of medicines. For breast cancer drugs used in the neoadjuvant setting, overall survival is likely to take at least 15 years to collect. Waiting for this long before making a decision about whether a treatment can be made available on the NHS would means that patients are facing unacceptable delays for potentially innovative treatments. We believe that this is a significant issue for pharmaceutical companies, as exclusivity patents would be very close to expiry by the time overall survival data comes in. This raises a question about how further innovation in these types of drugs would be incentivised in the future. We would like NICE to refer this question to the NICE Decision Support Unit in order to:
1. produce guidance for companies, which may be working on neoadjuvant cancer drugs of the future, to set out clearly what kinds of evidence companies will need to provide in order to gain a NICE approval
2. assess and analyse the issue of neoadjuvant drugs more broadly to decide whether seeking overall survival is appropriate for these types of medicines, given the very long times frames involved, especially comparing to the level of evidence NICE requires for cancer and other long term conditions and whether this is comparable."""
Rimegepant_for_treating_migraine.pdf,"1. Yes, it is an innovative technology, first of its class of CGRP receptor antagonist, marketed as both an acute and preventative treatment as an orally disintegrating tablet to be taken (for prevention) every other day. Its tolerability and safety are similar to placebo with no known cardiovascular risk.

Rimegepant is a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, a novel mode of action, and will be the first agent designed for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine. It offers a therapeutic option for those in whom other classes of drugs and contraindicated or not tolerated.

Yes, an oral acute and preventative treatment that can be used in patients with co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease.

2. The treatment is first of its kind that is effective both as abortive and preventive treatment. It is oral formulation and has a safety profile similar to placebo. Rimegepant is a CGRP receptor antagonist – this is the first of its kind to be available as a therapeutic option of both abortive and preventive treatment.

3. Oral formulation and lower side effect profile with confer benefit. Yes, it is considered a step-change in the management and addresses the need for an alternative oral formulation than currently available. The side effects or adverse effects are minimal."

Lenalidomide_plus_dexamethasone_for_previously_untreated_multiple_myeloma.pdf,"1. There is an unmet need for treatments with a different mechanism of action and reduced side effect profile for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. Lenalidomide is an innovative and effective treatment to add to the myeloma treatment pathway for patients who are ineligible for HDT-SCT. Approving lenalidomide in this setting significantly improves treatment options for this group of patients, enabling doctors to personalize treatment and choose the option best suited to the clinical situation.

Lenalidomide can substantially increase progression free and overall survival; outcomes which are valued highly by patients. Lenalidomide gives patients the opportunity to achieve a deeper response at first treatment which is beneficial to long-term survival. It offers patients improved quality of life through its reduced side effect profile and by treating the underlying disease and reducing symptoms, helping patients to lead enjoyable, fulfilling and productive lives. This also lessens the burden on carers and family members. Its oral formulation is welcomed by patients, giving them more control over their day to day lives. The oral regimen is especially helpful to older frailer patients who will also derive particular benefit from its reduced side effect profile and the fact it is given in a two drug combination.

2. Yes. Quality of life likely to be improved due to reduced myeloma associated complications, less hospital attendance and ease of administration. This is an effective all oral treatment.

3. Yes, ability to deliver continuous therapy has not been feasible previously. Ability to receive continuous therapy and be able to deliver therapy for patients with neuropathy.

Baricitinib_for_treating_severe_alopecia_areata.pdf,"1. Baricitinib is innovative as it has demonstrated the greatest efficacy out of all other systemics previously used such as ciclosporin, methotrexate and azathioprine, and with a better side effects profile and level of immunosuppression. Other current therapies include contact immunotherapy (diphenylcyclopropenone) which is not readily available as only a few centres in the UK are able to deliver this service. Good-quality wigs are expensive and there is variability in access to/support for these across the UK; also, this intervention does not help with facial/body hair loss. Baricitinib will make a significant impact on health-related benefits as their AA can be better controlled, by extension their well-being will improve, thus having a positive impact on the psychosocial aspects of their life.

Esketamine_nasal_spray_for_treatment-resistant_depression.pdf,"1. This is an innovative technology in the treatment of depression. It has a significantly different mechanism of working from existing antidepressants, acting on the NMDA pathway, and is administered via a nasal spray under clinical supervision. These two features make it significantly different from other treatments for depression.

For patients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to existing antidepressant treatments, the treatment offers the potential for improved compliance with medication; the alleviation of symptoms that could result in a much improved quality of life for patients and carers; and greater help in preventing suicide in those patients with suicidal ideation as a result of their condition.

2. Yes. Novel mechanism of action. Possible alternate treatment to ECT. Only treatment currently available that appears to have an acute anti-suicidal effect in patients with depression."

Avelumab_for_maintenance_treatment_of_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_urothelial_cancer_after_platinum-based_chemotherapy.pdf,"1. Bladder Cancer has had relatively little research or new treatment developments in recent decades. Despite it being the 4th most prevalent cancer in men and 7th overall, and very expensive for the NHS to treat, mortality rates of c50% have shown NO improvement in the past 30 years. The mechanism of this new drug is different from anything available to treat bladder cancer today; hence the treatment is highly innovative.

ABC UK supports the licensing and use of the treatment within the NHS. Ideally more research could be commissioned to optimise the treatment regimen and to better understand the mechanism of treatment, ultimately leading to biomarkers to identify patients for whom the treatment would be most effective.

2. Hugely innovative- combination treatment of checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy has not worked. Second line immunotherapy benefits a subset. Maintenance after chemotherapy will have a large contribution on health related benefits for bladder cancer patients.

3. The standard of care is best supportive care with surveillance CT scans at 3 months intervals. This technology brings the use of immune check point inhibitors earlier in the disease pathway and brings substantial impact on health related benefits for this group of patients. Yes, it is a step change in the management of this condition.

Nivolumab_for_treating_locally_advanced_unresectable_or_metastatic_urothelial_cancer_after_platinum-containing_chemotherapy.pdf,"1. The mechanism of this new drug is different from anything available to treat BC today, hence the treatment is highly innovative. ABC UK supports the licensing and use of the treatment within the NHS. Ideally, more research could be commissioned to optimise the treatment regimen and to better understand the mechanism of treatment, ultimately leading to biomarkers to identify patients for whom the treatment would be most effective/ineffective.

2. Yes. Immunotherapy is the first new approach to treatment for this disease in decades and the only alternative to chemotherapy. It addresses the fact that without treatment, patients die on average in 4.5 months and chemotherapy has modest efficacy in this setting. A notable proportion of patients derive prolonged disease control with maintenance of quality of life in response to nivolumab. This is usually well tolerated and on average a little better than with chemotherapy. However, a minority will experience significant treatment related toxicity (18% grade 3 or 4 adverse event rate in the Checkmate 275 trial of which diarrhoea and fatigue were most common). Toxicity can commonly be addressed with dose delay and use of corticosteroids. Treatment discontinuation is required occasionally but most patients will tolerate treatment to allow it to continue until the point of disease progression."

Axicabtagene_ciloleucel_for_treating_diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma_and_primary_mediastinal_large_B-cell_lymphoma_after_2_or_more_systemic_therapies.pdf,"1. YES

2. NHS England regards axicabtagene ciloleucel as highly innovative in terms of its mode of action: genetic engineering to T cells to recruit an immune response which results in a 'living' treatment against large cell lymphoma. But however clever or neat a technology may be, it is what a treatment does to meaningful outcomes for patients which results in NHS England concluding whether a new treatment is a game changer or not. CAR T cell therapy fulfills this definition of a potential game changer if it is confirmed that there are very or no few relapses in the period of 12-24 months after treatment and if there is no substantial long term toxicity.

3. Yes. The technology is undoubtedly a 'step-change' in the management of the condition. It addresses the relapsed refractory population where current treatment options are generally unsatisfactory.

4. The response to the question across both images discusses the technology axi-cel, which is a novel CAR T cell therapy for treating certain types of lymphoma. The technology is deemed highly innovative due to its personalized nature and its ability to target cancer cells via a novel surface receptor fragment antibody that identifies and locks onto CD19 cells on lymphoma cells. This personalized approach involves a complex process, from blood cell collection and manufacturing, to cell delivery, which spans 21-24 days. Although innovative, the technology also requires substantial infrastructure and resources, including specific care during delivery, management of potential adverse effects, and preparation for emergency intensive care needs.

The necessary infrastructure and resources for implementation are not fully established, indicating significant planning and development are needed for wider application. This includes workforce and infrastructure adjustments, handling and administration training, and creating new arrangements for preparation, procurement, and manufacture of the technology. The NHS currently lacks the complete setup for implementing this CAR-T technology optimally, highlighted by the need for phased implementation and clinical capacity planning. The overall opinion suggests that while the technology is innovative with potential substantial health benefits, it presents considerable implementation challenges that need to be addressed to meet current healthcare needs effectively.

5. Clinical experts state the technology is a step change and potentially a game changer in an area of high unmet need and is therefore likely to be considered innovative, but no additional benefits outside QALY gains have been identified. Clinical trial evidence shows a significant improvement in overall survival compared with salvage chemotherapy (the current treatment options for people with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). However, the data is immature and there is uncertainty around the appropriate adjustment to comparative cohorts and correct methods for extrapolation. Extended follow-up could provide more robust estimates on which the committee could base its decision. Recommendation for the CDF would require plausible potential of the technology to be cost-effective. All plausible estimates using current list price are higher than what NICE normally considers good use of NHS resources.

The ERG highlighted previous NICE committees applying discretion in determining whether it reasonable to apply a weight to the QALYs gained acknowledging the large survival benefit and represented a step-change in treatment. The company stated that axi-cel provides complete personalised immunotherapy. It has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile and offers a new and effective treatment option for patients with no curative options and short expected survival.

8. Kite/Gilead believe this is a potential area of discussion following the NICE Technology Appraisal Committee meeting in July.

Exagamglogene_autotemcel_for_treating_transfusion-dependent_beta-thalassaemia_in_people_12_years_and_over.pdf,"1. NICE considers how innovative a new treatment is when making its recommendations. If the company considers the new treatment to be innovative please explain how it represents a ‘step change’ in treatment and/or effectiveness compared with current treatments. Are there any QALY benefits that have not been captured in the economic model that also need to be considered (see section 3f)? Exa-cel is the first medicine in the world to be made using the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR/Cas-9 technology that acts as a kind of ‘genetic scissors’ to accurately edit genes at the exact desired location. It offers a one-time treatment that allows patients with beta-thalassaemia to achieve a disease-free state by treating the underlying cause of the disease. By removing the need for blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, exa-cel is expected to reduce the number of new illnesses that these treatments often cause. This means that patients will not need to regularly attend medical appointments. As discussed in section 3f) above, exa-cel brings patients many QALY benefits that cannot be captured in the economic model but are important to be considered.

2. This is a new technology that will revolutionise the way patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia are managed. There is no other treatment available that works in the same way, or offers the same chance of total cure, outside of the small population of patients who have suitable sibling donors for allogenic bone marrow transplantation. <10% of patients have a suitable sibling donor. The remainder of patients are reliant on regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy which is difficult to tolerate and comes with its own health complications. These patients have had no real progress in their management for at least a decade and this technology would address their unmet need.

3. Yes. The main findings on TDT patient reported experience surveys focusing on quality of life, have consistently shown the significant burden of the diagnosis, with a large amount of time spent in health institutions receiving care, a high burden of fatigue, pain and reduced quality of life. This technology based on the early phase trials results would be expected to lead to significant improvements as the need for regular transfusions will either stop entirely or reduce very markedly. This technology, exagamglogene autotemcel offers a curative option at the level of the stem cell, but does not require an allogeneic donor, hence will be more accessible for patients who do not have suitable matched sibling donors. This technology promises to increase the option of cure to many more TDT individuals. Currently less than 25% of TDT patients who are eligible to receive matched sibling donor stem cell transplants will be able to proceed as most will lack a donor. Additionally, this technology will avoid the unacceptable adverse effects of graft rejection and graft versus host disease that are seen in allogeneic stem cell transplants. As this is an autologous product there will be no requirement for prolonged immunosuppression after treatment. As the only curative option available currently is the matched sibling donor, less than 25% of TDT patients will have a matched sibling donor available to donate to them. Exagamglogene autotemcel which autologous, hence uses stem cells taken from the patient, is highly innovative and offers the option of cure to a wider population of patients with severe sickle cell disease. There are no other comparative curative options available for sickle cell disease apart from a matched sibling donor SCT.

4. I do, the treatment is potentially transformative in its ability to deliver a cure, providing transfusion independence and likely associated reduction in morbidity and mortality. The treatment is attractive in that it should be a ‘once off’ treatment that requires very occasional subsequent follow up.

5. I think that is is a “step change” in the management of thalassaemia. Patients have limited curative options and this would add another one.

6. I believe we are in the era of gene therapy in the treatment of haemoglobin disorders such as transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia. This technology is a step change in the management of this condition- as patients without suitable stem cell donors can now expect to achieve transfusion independence with a step cell therapy. The unmet need of this population is the severe lack to therapies available for this disease group – currently only two- namely blood transfusion or stem cell transplant, the latter not suitable for all.

7. Yes, exa-cel offers the option of a cure to patients with TDT, which is unavailable to most currently. It is without doubt a step-change in management as it results in long-term cure for most, with patients becoming transfusion-independent or at least having very significantly reduced transfusion requirements after treatment. The removal of regular transfusions means that any residual iron can be removed quickly and effectively with either venesection or lower-dose iron chelation, and following this the patient is not expected to develop any further complications of TDT or of iron loading.

Exa-cel addresses the unmet need of the vast majority of the TDT population to have access to a curative treatment. This chance is only currently available to a small minority with a matched donor.

8. It is imperative that the committee discusses whether it could make a routine recommendation at the end of managed access with the proposed data collection; it is unclear whether 3 or 3.75 years of data would be sufficient to convince committee of lifetime benefits. The company are planning an initial 8 years of data collection with the period of managed access. Would this truly be sufficient enough to satisfy committee to recommend this as ex-officio routine commissioning, given the important remaining uncertainties that cannot be resolved through managed access?

9. Exa-cel is considered a promising innovative medicine as it would be expected to lead to significant clinical benefits and would addresses a high unmet need. It is therefore eligible to be considered for the Innovative Medicines Fund."

As already mentioned despite optimum treatment with RAS blocking drugs, many patients with DKD progress to ESKD needing dialysis and kidney transplantation. Furthermore, these patients are at a very high risk of CVD, hospitalisation and mortality. Finerenone is likely to mitigate both progression to ESKD and CVD events.

2. Yes, Chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes can have such a debilitating impact on patients’ lives. Unfortunately, this disease is far reaching, as up to 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease.

3. Although the results from the recent trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD (CREDENCE, DAPA CKD & EMPA-KIDNEY) are very encouraging, people with the combination of CKD and type 2 diabetes remain at very high risk of morbidity and premature mortality. This unmet need is being partially addressed by finerenone, which I would regard as a 'step-change' in management.

4. I believe this is innovative, in the sense that it is a novel therapy which has been shown in outcome trials to prevent heard renal end points in large scale trials in people with diabetic kidney disease. Until recently since the advent of SGLT2i trials we have not had proven new therapies for almost 2 decades in this area."
Pembrolizumab_with_chemotherapy_before_surgery_(neoadjuvant)_then_alone_after_surgery_(adjuvant)_for_treating_resectable_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes. The main additional utility is incorporating the post operative component for which there is a suggestion of additional benefit esp in those not achieving a pCR (although this needs prospective validation).

2. This technology would be an addition to similar treatments already in use (as outlined above) so cannot be considered a “step-change” in the management of resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The use of adjuvant immunotherapy following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is not in clinical use currently and may be an advantage over neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy alone, particularly in those patients with an incomplete pathological response."
Andexanet_alfa_for_reversing_anticoagulation_from_apixaban_or_rivaroxaban.pdf,"1. Yes. Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? Yes. Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population? Yes.

2. It is an innovative approach but it is not possible to conclude that it has any beneficial impact in the absence of a comparative study with current treatments. The published data do not establish any clear benefit. It may be of benefit in patients with acute major bleeding in association with a clinically significant level of anti-Xa activity due to DOAC treatment. However, there is 10% risk of thrombosis following the treatment with Andexanet alfa. There is an unmet need for better therapy to reverse the new anticoagulants but it is not clear that this is met by Andexanet.

3. The response in the images to question 17 about whether the technology is innovative in its potential to significantly impact health-related benefits and improve current needs is:

- Is the technology a 'step-change' in the management of the condition? No
- Does the use of the technology address any particular unmet need of the patient population? Yes

Glecaprevir–pibrentasvir_for_treating_chronic_hepatitis_C.pdf,"1. As described in Section B.2.13 (Innovation), in the context of the current treatment landscape described above G/P has the potential to simplify the clinical pathway of care in HCV by providing a well-tolerated, once-daily, oral treatment with a short (8 week) treatment duration in a large proportion of patients with HCV (i.e. TN NC patients), an anticipated pan-genotypic marketing authorisation, no requirement for baseline resistance-associated variant (RAV) and viral load testing in patient groups within the anticipated licence, and the potential to remove the requirement for genotyping to make treatment decisions. G/P addresses an unmet need for HCV therapy in several specific CHC patient populations, as recognised by its Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) status and Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) designation, including patients with severe renal impairment and specific TE GT3 patients. Finally, in recognition of the fact that the cost of HCV treatment has a relatively high budget impact, the manufacturer has undertaken to introduce a confidential pricing agreement with NHSE’s commissioning medicines unit (CMU).

2. The response to the question ""Do you consider the technology to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how might it improve the way that current need is met?"" is not completed in the provided images. The question appears at the end of the first image but the response box is empty and does not continue in the second image. Therefore, there is no response given in these images.

3. The trial data that I have seen suggests these are more potent agents with possibly a higher barrier to resistance than some of the current DAA drugs. Introduction of DAA therapy was a step-change. Introduction of second generation DAA drugs will improve SVR12 rates from very high to extremely high. Yes for those patients who have failed NS5a containing regimens.

4. Yes as a retreatment option and for patients on dialysis. It is a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and addresses a particular unmet need of the patient population.

5. The technology introduces a potent and highly effective regimen to current treatments. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are large improvements over the current ritonavir based regimen of paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir and improve the overall outlook for treatment experienced genotype 3 patients."
Relugolix–estradiol–norethisterone_acetate_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_symptoms_of_uterine_fibroids.pdf,"1. Yes, I consider this technology a step change in the care and treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids. It addresses the many unmet needs and benefits in the care of patients with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids. This is an oral, patient control of treatment with >50% reduction in menstrual blood loss, fewer side effects than Esmya or GnRH agonist. It also offers the benefits of fewer contacts with healthcare provides for menstrual problems saving quality time for patients and medical staff, which is very important in women from lower socio-economic class and BAME group."

Deucravacitinib_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_plaque_psoriasis.pdf,1. Yes. Targeting the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a new treatment approach for psoriasis. Apremilast has been less well adopted due to lower response rates when compared with biologics. Data for deucravacitinib suggest higher response rates which may see it used more widely.
Pemigatinib_for_treating_relapsed_or_refractory_advanced_cholangiocarcinoma_with_FGFR2_fusion_or_rearrangement.pdf,"1. I believe the use of Pemigatinib in chemorefractory cholangiocarcinoma would make a significant impact on health-related benefits for these patients by improving their quality of life, extending their life expectancy (as discussed above).

Yes, because it is the first time we observe these remarkable data in the second line setting in cholangiocarcinoma patients with a remarkable response rate of 36% (including complete responses never observed with other therapies), an impressive median overall survival of 21 months in patients who have already progressed to first line treatment.

This also represents the first positive example of precision oncology in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, underlining the need to rethink the therapeutic strategy of this tumour type, where molecular characterization becomes at the base of an individualized treatment.

Yes, cholangiocarcinoma patients lack effective therapeutic options. Pemigatinib fills this gap by confirming a remarkable value for a subpopulation of patients.

2. Yes, the technology appears to have significant effects in length of disease control (~double compared to other interventions) and possible survival. Yes, in the patients with FGFR molecular alterations will change outcomes. Yes , the technology offers the opportunity for personalised, precision medicine."

Encorafenib_with_binimetinib_for_unresectable_or_metastatic_BRAF_V600_mutation-positive_melanoma.pdf,"1. Yes – this regimen offers a better tolerated, easier to use regimen compared with standard dabrafenib+trametinib. No, it’s the same class of drug, but with benefits described as above.

2. This is the same technology as other treatments already available so I wouldn’t regard it as a step change, rather an alternative option for patients who don’t do well on the alternatives. Yes for those intolerant of existing agents."
Ozanimod_for_treating_moderately_to_severely_active_ulcerative_colitis.pdf,"1. Treatment options for UC are limited in comparison to other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Having an alternative agent with an alternative mode of action is of benefit to all patients, especially those whom have tried and failed other agents.

Ozanimod was found to be significantly more effective at inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC in comparison to placebo.

Novel mechanism of action in comparison to current medical treatment options in ulcerative colitis

Yes, it could be used as 2nd/3rd line treatment if current licensed biologic therapies are clinically inappropriate. It could be placed at the same position as tofacitinib in ulcerative colitis treatment pathway. Additional medical treatment options with new mechanism of action for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis before surgical intervention."

Brolucizumab_for_treating_wet_age-related_macular_degeneration.pdf,"1. There may be a small benefit over existing treatments but it is hard to be sure from the data because of the trial design. No, it is possibly a small incremental change for the better.

2. This may represent a small incremental change for the better although the data is difficult to reach firm conclusions from particularly as the key studies were non inferiority design.

3. I do not believe it is an innovative treatment compared to currently available options. No, the technology does not address any particular unmet need of the patient population."
Certolizumab_pegol_for_treating_moderate_to_severe_plaque_psoriasis.pdf,"1. Yes, it is a PEGylated anti-TNF and the only biologic that does not cross the placenta. Yes, women of child-bearing potential who are planning conception or are pregnant. Certolizumab pegol seems to have a comparable safety profile with other biologic therapies, although there is currently little data about its safety in a real-world population.

2. No

3. Yes, as mentioned above. Certolizumab is different from other TNF inhibitors. Certolizumab pegol lacks an Fc region, thus it does not bind FcRn and is consequently not expected to undergo FcRn mediated transfer across the placenta. There is also the possibility of dose escalation if necessary.

While TNF inhibitors are established standard of care in psoriasis, there is variation between drugs and patient responses. As mentioned previously certolizumab may provide better outcomes compared to other TNF inhibitors and additional choice for patients and physicians.

Yes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a high maintenance of response to certolizumab in patients with plaque psoriasis.

Also, a subset of patients treated with biologics fail to respond to treatment and some patients who initially respond will lose response over time. As a result, in clinical practice some patients might require dose escalation of biologics as a measure to improve efficacy. The clinical trials have also demonstrated an increased efficacy for the higher dose of certolizumab, thus supporting the possibility of dose escalation for these patients.

In addition, active transport of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) across the placenta is mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Certolizumab lacks an Fc region, thus it does not bind FcRn and is consequently not expected to undergo FcRn mediated transfer across the placenta. Physiologically, only minimal amounts of certolizumab are likely to cross into breast milk and be absorbed by the infant, due to its large molecule size. The certolizumab CRIB and CRADLE studies demonstrated minimal transfer of active drug from mother to infant across the placenta and into breastmilk."

Foslevodopa–foscarbidopa_for_treating_advanced_Parkinson’s_with_motor_symptoms.pdf,"1. This technology is innovative. Yes, it may improve the way that the current need is met.

2. Yes – this is an innovative technology with the potential to make a significant and substantial impact on the lives of many people with Parkinson’s. This is a step-change in Parkinson’s management.

3. This is a novel approach to treatment using a subcutaneous infusible formulation of levodopa (prodrug). It is not a dopamine agonist like apomorphine so does not have the side effects of that class of drug. It does not require PEJ tube insertion or brain surgery as for deep brain stimulation. It could be given in a local centre quite possibly more near the patient’s home. It could be set up and given from a district hospital base. It is given over 24 hours so it is reasonable that the stabilisation in plasma levels might lower the future risk of dyskinesias. Other advanced therapies like LCIG or apomorphine are not 24 hour infusions so it is possible that better overall 24 hour control could be achieved. In all these ways the new technology is innovative. 
It seems to be a highly effective treatment which is simpler to administer than some other therapies for advanced PD."
Elacestrant_for_treating_oestrogen_receptor-positive_HER2-negative_advanced_breast_cancer_with_an_ESR1_mutation_after_endocrine_treatment.pdf,"1. Yes – there will be quality of life benefits for patients (fewer side effects, better tolerated, psychological reassurance of another line of non-cytotoxic therapy). Also benefits to oncology services with an easily administered treatment requiring less intense monitoring. Potentially fewer outpatient oncology encounters and blood tests required, particularly once established on the new technology. We could review patients every 3 months in clinic with scan results rather than monthly appointments and blood tests for everolimus. Yes, a step change in that for the first time (at least for a subgroup of patients) we have an effective non-chemotherapy option after cdk4/6 therapy.

2. Treatment regime would be oral so can be delivered in home care setting or outpatient setting without the need to access chemotherapy unit. Elacestrant is an innovation in targeting the ESR1 mutation which is one of the main drivers for endocrine resistance."
Regorafenib_for_previously_treated_unresectable_or_metastatic_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumours.pdf,"1. Bayer considers regorafenib as an innovative treatment offering a step-change for the management of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST whose disease has progressed on, or who are intolerant to, previous treatment with imatinib and sunitinib. This is based on the two following reasons:

- In England, no licenced treatment is currently recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST whose disease has progressed on, or who are intolerant to, previous treatment with imatinib and sunitinib.
  
- Cross-over adjusted OS analyses showed a median OS increase varying between 5.5 and 6.3 months in favor of regorafenib when compared against BSC."
Pembrolizumab_for_untreated_metastatic_colorectal_cancer_with_high_microsatellite_instability_or_mismatch_repair_deficiency.pdf,"1. Yes – the responses, duration of response and possibility to offer patients chemo free treatment and possibly chemo-free life with far less side effects than SOC chemotherapy is innovative. In addition, as some patients may go into long term remission/never relapse so will never need further lines of systemic therapy, palliative surgery or radiotherapy.

Osimertinib_for_treating_EGFR_T790M_mutation-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer.pdf,"1. Yes, the technology is considered to be innovative in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how it might improve the way that current need is met. Additionally, it is noted as a 'step-change' in the management of the condition and clearly addresses an unmet need for alternative targeted therapies for advanced EGFR mutation positive lung cancer.

2. Yes – the identification of the T790M mutation and the proven efficacy of Osimertinib against this mutation is cutting edge and illustrates the evolution / resistance mechanism in the EGFR landscape and how effective a 3rd generation EGFR TKI is against it. The efficacy over chemotherapy is clearly illustrated by the AURA 3 clinical trial. The technology is a landmark development in the management of this condition. It provides an effective / life prolonging treatment for patients that acquire the T790M mutation following first line treatment with anti-EGFR TKI."

Zanubrutinib_for_treating_chronic_lymphocytic_leukaemia.pdf,"1. The technology is the second generation of the innovative BTKis, bringing increased efficacy with a reduction in side effects, but not with any additional innovation in the mode of action. It would be a step-change to make a BTKi available as a first treatment to young patients with or without p53 deletion or mutation, with an optimal side effect profile. In addition, in the relapse setting, minimizing the cardiac side effect profile of medication will have a significant effect on quality of life.

2. Technology is very similar to existing Acalabrutinib; in fact the company have presented it as non-inferior. No direct comparison either from trials or the real world is available. Trials represent the available treatment choices in the UK at the time of the trial. These choices have evolved with new evidence and NICE TAs, but the results remain entirely relevant to UK practice. In the R/R setting, the randomised phase 3 ALPINE R/R trial is comparable with UK clinical practice, comparing Zanubrutinib to Ibrutinib (currently available in this setting in the UK) in patients who had received at least one course of therapy. At 24 months, PFS was superior in the investigational arm (78.4% vs 75.9%, p=0.002). In addition, Zanubrutinib had improved PFS across all subgroups, including those with p53 deletion or mutation. Overall response was higher and discontinuation rates lower; with a reduction in cardiac events and deaths in Zanubrutinib patients. Data in untreated patients compared Zanubrutinib to R-Bendamustine. This was an appropriate comparator with UK practice at the time of the SEQUIA trial design in patients >65, or not fit enough for FCR. Median PFS was not reached (95% CI: NE, NE) in the zanubrutinib cohort compared with 33.7 months (95% CI: 28.1, NE) in the BR cohort (HR= 0.42, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.63; p=<0.0001). Since the positive NICE appraisals for Ven-O and Acalabrutinib, however, it is now very rare for CIT to be offered as first line therapy. In addition, in fit and young patients, we know that Ibrutinib is superior to both R-Bendamustine and FCR (the previous gold standard therapy) in a Phase 3 upfront setting. Given that we see reduced arrhythmic adverse effects, reduced discontinuations and improved PFS in the R/R setting with Zanubrutinib vs

3. Zanubrutinib would be improving efficacy and safety profile compared to other BTKis (Alpine study). One would expect Zanubrutinib to be cheaper than other BTKis if approved and have a social impact by reducing health care costs."
Naldemedine_for_treating_opioid-induced_constipation.pdf,"1. PAMORAs are innovative in terms of their MOA. They address the particular unmet need of patients with OIC related to cancer pain.

2. The PAMORAs are innovative, but it is unclear whether there are clinically significant differences between the PAMORAs (as there have been no head-to-head comparisons). PAMORAs are a definite ""step change"" in the management of opioid-induced constipation. Yes – many patients with opioid-induced constipation are undertreated, or receiving treatment that is not well tolerated (i.e. conventional laxatives).

Selective_internal_radiation_therapies_for_treating_hepatocellular_carcinoma.pdf,"1. SIR-Spheres have been licensed for use in the UK since 2002. However, SIR-Spheres can be considered innovative due to their ability to alter the treatment paradigm for unresectable HCC:

- SIR-Spheres offer a chance of potentially curative therapy to at least 5% of patients who would not otherwise have this opportunity. In the SARAH trial, 5.1% of patients who received SIR-Spheres were down-staged after treatment and as such became eligible for potentially curative treatments, compared with 1.4% of the sorafenib group.

- SIR-Spheres are associated with a better quality of life for patients than sorafenib. Quality of life is impaired with sorafenib due to the chronic administration of the therapy leading to long-lasting AEs. In the SARAH trial, the difference in AE rates between SIR-Spheres and sorafenib translated into a HRQL benefit measured by the global health status sub-score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument, which was significantly better in the SIR-Spheres arm than the sorafenib arm.

- Selection of the target population for SIR-Spheres based on tumour burden and ALBI grade allows for this intervention to be offered to patients most likely to benefit. The SARAH trial found that 22% (53/237) of patients randomised to SIR-Spheres did not receive this treatment, 42 of which had received a work-up. Some patients enrolled in the SARAH trial would not be considered good candidates for SIRT in current clinical practice in the UK.

2. SIR-Spheres has been licensed for use in the UK since 2002. However, SIR-Spheres can be considered innovative due to its ability to alter the treatment paradigm for unresectable HCC.

SIR-Spheres offer a step-change in the management of patients with unresectable HCC who are eligible for TACE.

3. The technology is much more likely to provide a curative outcome in a subgroup of patients than current available therapies and it is better tolerated than TACE and sorafenib. This technology is capable of delivering substantial health-related benefits for BCLC B and some BCLC C (PVT) patients who are without a potentially curative option. In the patients with large volume unilobar disease (particularly those without cirrhosis and with good liver function) who are inherently poor TACE candidates, SIRT has great potential to induce excellent clinical responses, prolong life, bridge or downstage to transplant or resection. In the subgroup noted above."

Mexiletine_for_treating_the_symptoms_of_myotonia_in_non-dystrophic_myotonic_disorders.pdf,"1. Myotonia affects patients on a daily basis. Non-dystrophic myotonia is not a life-limiting illness in adults and most do maintain employment. However, it can have significant impact on quality of life, can influence choice of career and cause significant difficulty in taking public transport. This in turn can limit work and social activity and general independence. As well as the obvious symptom of myotonia (muscle stiffness) it can frequently cause pain and fatigue. Living with a chronic illness can affect mood. Myotonia affecting the leg muscles can lead to falls, and injury.

Impact on quality of life, mobility, and independence may not be fully captured by a QALY calculation.

Vandetanib_for_treating_medullary_thyroid_cancer.pdf,NULL
Ibrutinib_for_treating_Waldenstrom’s_macroglobulinaemia.pdf,"1. Yes. It is generally well tolerated drug that offers patients a more targeted approach of treatment of their WM. It has a relatively quick time to action and so can help relieve symptoms of patients very quickly. It also has in trials and real world evidence, prolonged PFS that can have a substantial impact for the patient. It avoids patients having to come into hospital so frequently for intravenous therapy.

Yes, first in class and first targeted therapy licensed for use in WM. Tolerated by patients who are old and frail who may not be suitable for chemoimmunotherapy.

2. Quality of life is very important and isn’t always reflected in the clinical trials. I believe that quality of life is improved for patients on ibrutinib, and the speed of response which can also have an impact is improved by ibrutinib. Furthermore, even once progressed as defined by international criteria, the patient may stay on treatment for a period of time afterwards as there may be no indication to immediately change treatment. Yes, given that the only current standard therapies are chemoimmunotherapies. Yes, this gives an option for those who are unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy and helps to reduce the need for repeated lines of chemoimmunotherapy which will increase potential long term toxicity.

3. Yes- the mechanism of action of Ibrutinib provides a completely different approach to treating WM, compared to traditionally applied chemoimmunotherapy. Used as part of the therapeutic arsenal, this technology makes a massive impact on health-related benefits and helps to prolong life."
Cabozantinib_for_untreated_advanced_renal_cell_carcinoma.pdf,"1. Cabozantinib is already available as a first-line treatment for advanced RCC in the USA. Currently, UK cancer survival rates trail about 10 years behind other comparable European countries, including Italy and Austria. If the UK is to improve patient outcomes, including the patient experience as well as overall survival, it is vital that innovative new drugs are made available to patients in order that they have the best possible care. If these drugs are not made available, it leaves UK patients at a major disadvantage in terms of the availability of innovative cancer treatments; these patients are likely to die prematurely compared to kidney cancer patients in other rich countries. A contributory factor to poor survival rates in the UK is possibly due to the restrictions in clinical choice brought about by UK regulatory authorities.

In the absence of biomarkers for the treatment of RCC, clinicians are not able to predict which patients will respond to which drug, and drug selection is accomplished by trial and error. Clinicians should have the ability to choose the most effective treatments for individual patients from those available, and without cabozantinib, the clinician’s choice of treatment is seriously compromised. Without treatment alternatives in the first-line most patients will face disease progression. A choice of treatment is paramount for the effective management of the progression of this disease and maintenance of quality of life:  

“Whilst I have not had direct experience of taking Cabozantinib as I am still responding to Pazopanib, I have read both the clinical trial reports and real world patient experience. I believe that this would form a useful addition to the portfolio of drugs available to clinicians and will be especially useful for those patients with bone metastasis. The addition of more potential drugs would introduce more competitive pricing between suppliers.”

Current first-line treatment options are not effective for everyone. Undue restrictions in accessing cabozantinib would simply add unnecessary additional burden to patients with a terminal diagnosis. Having more choice in the first-line setting would enable patients and oncologists to individualize treatment plans according to specific disease/treatment history and contraindications, thereby enabling the best possible quality of life for the patient. Cabozantinib will also address the massive unmet need for an effective treatment option for bone metastases in the first-line setting.

The following statements are from a patient carer and two patients talking about the importance of having a choice of treatment:

“Another important consideration to factor is that some drugs can work better later in the cycle of this disease, what

2. No

3. Cabozantinib is a newer and potentially more powerful TKI therapy. This form of therapy has been the routine management of metastatic renal cancer for the past decade. It would be regarded as a clinically useful improvement to the technology rather than a new innovation. Yes, the technology represents a ‘step-change’ in the management of the condition. The clinical benefits in terms of enhanced response rates and duration of treatment benefit from Cabozantinib appear to apply across the patient population."

3. This therapy is a step change for the immune-compromised population in the UK who have not received equitable therapy compared to their immune-competent population. The other treatments are not as effective and for some vaccine response has been poor. Pre-exposure prophylaxis provides levelling up for this immune compromised population who have effectively been forgotten and have had a much higher morbidity and mortality compared to age matched controls.

Eplontersen_for_treating_hereditary_transthyretin-related_amyloidosis.pdf,"1. Possibly. The conjugation of the ASO is thought to significantly increase the pharmacological potency of the molecules allowing for substantially lower effective doses, which may increase the efficiency of ATTR reduction, and Eplontersen is given as a SC injection every 4 weeks compared to weekly Inotersen SC injections. Current studies have shown significant differences in outcome measures compared to historical placebo, but not compared directly/head-to-head with other disease modifying treatments currently available. The study suggests an improved side effect profile."
Vamorolone_for_treating_Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy_in_people_4_years_and_over.pdf,"1. Vamorolone is an innovative medicine which has the potential to address a substantial unmet need for patients. There is no curative treatment for DMD and current SoC (i.e., glucocorticoids) is unlicensed and associated with a number of severe side effects. As such, there is a significant unmet need for an effective, licensed treatment that has equal efficacy to existing therapies, but that minimises the risks of damaging side effects associated with current SoC, encouraging greater uptake and continuation of treatment.

2. Possibly - it might improve some aspects of quality of life, related to fewer adverse effects and better compliance with better treatment and hence better outcomes in those scenarios. Partially in patients who cannot tolerate steroids. There is also evidence in animal models that Vamorolone has a cardioprotective effect. This has not been investigated in humans yet but if shown to be the case may improve outcomes.

Oral_azacitidine_for_maintenance_treatment_of_acute_myeloid_leukaemia_after_induction_therapy.pdf,"1. Up until now, most post-consolidation maintenance chemotherapy regimens have not shown an improvement in overall survival, although some have shown an improvement in relapse free survival. Additionally delivering this form of chemotherapy is practical because it is an oral tablet and seems reasonably well tolerated, giving a reasonable quality of life. It should significantly improve the survival of patients following chemotherapy who cannot have a transplant. They may not be able to have a transplant because of their co-morbidities, frailty (especially following intensive chemotherapy) or because do not have a suitable donor.

2. Yes. It is the first effective maintenance therapy ever to be developed in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

3. Outside of FLT3 mutated AML, no post-consolidation maintenance chemotherapy regimens have shown an improvement in overall survival, although some have shown an improvement in disease free survival or relapse free survival. The QUAZAR trial is the first to show an overall survival advantage for maintenance therapy. Its use of oral azacitidine, unlike parenteral azacitidine; delivering this form of chemotherapy is practical because it is as an oral tablet and seems reasonably well tolerated, giving a reasonable quality of life. The oral form has these advantages and is likely more effective by delivering a higher pharmacokinetic dose of the drug. It gives an alternative pathway and improved survival for patients without a transplant option, either because they are from an ethnic group for which there are few donors on the international registries, they are not fit enough to go ahead with an allogeneic stem cell transplant, or the patient does not wish to go ahead with an allogeneic stem cell transplant, because of the risks of morbidity or mortality (for any other reason). 

The most important outcome is that maintenance chemotherapy extended overall survival significantly without adversely affecting quality of life for patients who cannot or do not wish to have an allogeneic stem cell transplant."

Empagliflozin_for_treating_chronic_heart_failure_with_preserved_or_mildly_reduced_ejection_fraction.pdf,"1. Yes – there is currently no alternative evidence-based treatment which shows reduction in hospital admission and cardiovascular death. These patients are often poorly managed as many HF services exclude them from their services due to lack of capacity and underfunding. Patients often have multiple hospital admissions at present.

2. Yes. Until now, no evidence-based therapy has been available for HFpEF/HFmrEF patients. The therapy addresses the major unmet needs of reducing hospital admissions and improving the quality of life. Reduced hospital admissions will greatly impact the quality of life for both patients and families.

3. Yes this a step change in management. The first medication to show a meaningful difference in clinical outcomes for HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF have a significant unmet need in terms of treatments to improve symptoms, quality of life and reduce deterioration. The SGLT2i go someway towards this."
Avalglucosidase_alfa_for_treating_Pompe_disease.pdf,"1. The provision of recombinant enzyme replacement therapy is an innovative step in treatment of Pompe disease, and this second-generation technology aims to improve the mechanistic efficacy of the enzyme replacement by increasing uptake to the target organs. The technology addresses the unmet need of the population for whom existing treatment is sub-optimal.

2. This is a second generation enzyme replacement therapy. The alterations which have been made to the enzyme are not especially innovative and are designed to improve the efficiency of treatment rather than being a step change in management.

3. The technology represents an evolutionary advance in Pompe and will impact on health status, deferring progression. The technology is not a revolutionary step-change, but an incremental advance in supportive care while we await future, hopefully more effective genetic therapies.

4. There remains considerable uncertainty about long-term clinical effectiveness. No additional equality considerations."

Yes, this technology has a clear PFS advantage over standard treatment which will be beneficial to patients. Yes, I think so – perhaps at this stage a small step but an important one for this group of patients."
